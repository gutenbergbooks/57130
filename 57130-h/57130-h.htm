PREFACE</h2></div>


<p>No prefatory remarks are necessary to introduce
the reader to the following pages. They emanated,
in the first place, from a desire for personal
instruction, and what the French term <i>le soulagement
du c&oelig;ur</i>, a combination&mdash;according to
Vauvenargues&mdash;calculated to prove useful to
one&#8217;s fellows, <i>car personne est seul de son espéce</i>.
Those who live on my plane of thought will
welcome this volume, and those who do not, will
easily find a way out of the difficulty presented
to them by their attempted perusal of its pages:
most modern houses are now provided with
wastepaper baskets of ample proportions!</p>

<p>My true reason for allowing myself to wander
into the paths of a preamble, springs from a
desire to thank my friends and colleagues for
their assistance in supplying me with many
interesting facts.</p>

<p>In particular I am indebted to Sir George
Donaldson for permission to reproduce his
Duiffoproucart Viol; to Dr William H. Cummings
for the use of his interesting old engraving of
Benjamin Hallet; to Mr W. E. Whitehouse for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
notes concerning Signor Piatti; to Mr Edward
Heron Allen for courteous admittance to his valuable
library, and for permission to reproduce the
handsome carved violoncello by Galli; to Mr
John Bridges for his photographs of &#8220;The King&#8221;
Amati, and for supplying me with many points
relating to its history; and to Miss Gertrude
Roberts for helpful research at the British
Museum.</p>

<p>Also I waft hearty acknowledgments to that
great host of musical historians&mdash;my predecessors&mdash;to
whose various records from century to
century we owe our present knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Is</span> there any city in the world that can&mdash;metaphorically
speaking&mdash;hold up its head beside this
place of mystery&mdash;London in a fog? Paris,
Berlin, Vienna, St Petersburg, New York&mdash;what
can they do in the production of a bilious-green,
murky-yellow species of hyperphysical abomination?
Nothing! Yet we English are not in
the least proud of our prerogative. Perhaps
elation is impossible among such depressing surroundings,
or, perhaps the true British spirit of
being satisfied with everything that <i>is</i> British,
because it <i>is</i> British, predominates too utterly to
admit of any other emotion.</p>

<p>From whatever cause our inertia springs, the
clue is too deeply locked away in every Cockney&#8217;s
heart to be revealed. The effect, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
is plainly seen in the total lack of epic
poetry, or chromatic musical depiction of the
thing. Our literature does not teem with such
lines as:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;The &#8217;cellist stood in the empty hall,</div>
<div class="verse">Whence all but himself had fled,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8216;&#8217;Tis the fog,&#8217; he sighed, &#8216;that has tired them all</div>
<div class="verse">And sent them so early to bed!&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>No! genius ignores the subject, and fills in the
weary hours of darkness with sighs, and gasps,
and chokes, like ordinary mortals.</p>

<p>What an outlook greets us this dull November
day! Misty bricks and mortar emerge and disappear
like swiftly buried cities. Hazy, indefinite,
dubious figures loom upon us out of the
darkness, like ancestral ghosts; dull thuds, faint
cries, strange stampings and gratings are transmitted
to our ears with telephonic minuteness;
and all the while our throats are aching, our
eyes are streaming, our noses are smarting, the
motor bus is useless, and&mdash;we don&#8217;t know where
we are.</p>

<p>Perhaps in all the gamut of human sensibility
there can be no more creepy sensation than that
of being lost in familiar surroundings. The
ruler of Hades himself, or Jupiter with his
thunderbolts, could not invent a more refined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
torture than that consummated in the paradox:
&#8220;Here I am!&mdash;Where am I?&#8221; Yet, how
ordinary has this impression become to the
dweller in London.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, boy! can you tell me where I am? I
thought I was near the South Kensington Station,
but&mdash;I begin to be horribly puzzled. That great
thing opposite looks just like the Parthenon!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Parth yer on!&#8221; exclaims a little urchin, apparently
emerging from nowhere, and brandishing
a torch as big as himself&mdash;&#8220;Parth, did yer
say? Yer on the parth roight enough! Want
a loight, loidy?&#8221; he adds, reserving further information
until he is sure of a customer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, to be sure! Don&#8217;t leave me
whatever you do! Where am I?&#8221; distractedly.
&#8220;What is that place opposite? I saw it a
moment ago, but&mdash;it&#8217;s gone again!&#8221; A pause&mdash;similar
to that which precedes each new slide
at a magic-lantern show&mdash;follows this speech,
then out of the darkness comes the excited exclamation:
&#8220;There! there it is! Now, what
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That there?&#8221; hoarsely mutters our impish
guide with a grin. &#8220;Why, that there&#8217;s the
Kensin&#8217;ton Mooseum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Kensington Museum! Surely it can&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
be! Why, it is the very place I have been looking
for for hours past. Do you think you can
get me across?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Git yer across!&#8221; with an accent of scorn,
&#8220;o&#8217; corse I can git yer across. You just keep
close alonga me, loidy, and we&#8217;ll git over in two
ticks.&#8221;</p>

<p>With torch held aloft and a hopeful heart he
makes a start and&mdash;returns to the comparative
safety of the pavement. Then he makes a
second hoppy trial&mdash;with the same result. We
begin to feel nervous, and search in our memory
for some battle-cry or epic poem with which to
fortify our courage, and drop upon Montrose&#8217;s
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;He either fears his fate too much,</div>
<div class="pindent">Or his deserts are small,</div>
<div class="verse">Who dares not put it to the touch</div>
<div class="pindent">To gain or lose it all.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Now then, &#8217;ere you are, look sharp!&#8221; shouts
our familiar urchin, utterly ignoring our poetic
mutterings. Straight away he plunges into the
chaos like an arrow shot from a bow. We
follow blindly, breathlessly, with the grace of a
polar bear after a gadfly, and in an incredibly
short space of time reach the safety of the
Museum doorway.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>What a transformation scene greets our eyes
when we enter! Here is a little Paradise
indeed: food, warmth, light, and all the
treasures of the Universe besides. Without&mdash;we
know&mdash;are horrors worse than Bluebeard&#8217;s
dungeons or the Underground Railway at
Gower Street. But what matter to us now
if the sky rains salt herrings and the streets be
full of roaring bulls, for we are safe from the
great Babel, although we can see its stir if we
will.</p>

<p>Come! sober scholar, gay <i>flaneur</i>, or ignoramus
(it is all the same), rest, and drink in the
fascinations of these armies of priceless china,
silver, glass, pictures, and furniture which shine,
and glint, and sparkle, and peep, in tantalising
invitation! Here are rare editions: historic
relics: miniatures, lace, statuary&mdash;in short, a
banquet to suit all tastes; and here, more
particularly, in the least prominent position, is
a unique collection of musical instruments,
hiding their heads in remoteness. It is regrettable
that many of these interesting relics of
the past are placed in such dark corners that a
good deal of nose-flattening and eye-straining
is necessary to see them at all. Still, one is
well rewarded for any slight personal inconvenience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
sustained in viewing them, for, apart
from their special interest, do they not stand
before us as the mute historians of the past?</p>

<p>Look at this old virginal, encased in what
was once rich red velvet, but now faded and
worn with the touch of many a vanished hand!
Behold those keys, brown with age! Yet these
were once white and responsive to the taper
fingers of that most consummate diplomatist,
Queen Bess. Surely it was just here, on this
side, that my Lord of Leicester stood bending
his proud head to eagerly plead an answer to
his oft-repeated suit! Or perhaps it was impulsive
Essex plucked and twitched the thing,
while he sued for the pardon of an elderly,
capricious coquette!</p>

<p>A little to the left of the historic virginal is
the harp of the ill-fated Marie Antoinette,
brave owner of that empty title, <i>Reine de
France</i>. What has been the history of the
graceful thing since that short space of calm
when its tones resounded in the Queen&#8217;s <i>Salon</i>
at the Tuileries? Was it also dragged after the
poor lady by a cruel infuriated mob, like the
harp of her friend, Mademoiselle de Lamballe?
Who knows! The tumbrels seem to rumble
by us as we gaze, and the sickening refrain:</p>

<p>rings in our ears.</p>

<p>Close beside this melancholy relic is the
cheering cast of Brian Borroimbe&#8217;s harp, which
was played on by that versatile King of Ireland
during the eleventh century. A little farther&mdash;in
an obscure corner&mdash;is the fiddle said to
have belonged to James I. of England, and
almost beneath it is a cast of the beautifully
carved violin which is generally supposed to
have been given to the Earl of Leicester by
Queen Elizabeth. Facing this is Handel&#8217;s harpsichord,
a plain, workmanlike little instrument
of neutral tint, and, and&mdash;can it be? or&mdash;is
it only the shadow of that pillar there
that deceives us into imagining that we see a
misty outlined figure near the keyboard?</p>

<p>At first it appears to take the form of a little
child, stretching his small fingers with loving
patience from note to note, while now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
again he glances timorously round, as though
fearful of detection.</p>

<p>Surely now it is Mr Handel himself: this
man before us, in full bob-wig and handsome
habiliments, can be no other than the successful
favourite of the highest in the land. There he
sits, with an expression of &#8220;Vat de tevil do I
care!&#8221; on his face, hammering out &#8220;The Harmonious
Blacksmith.&#8221; Not the man to trouble
himself about women, or succumb to the tender
passion, yet women were ever helpful and
friendly to him. As he plays, a strange medley
of figures gather round him: there is handsome
Sir Robert l&#8217;Estrange, smarting under the
indignity of being called &#8220;Cromwell&#8217;s fiddler&#8221;:
Cuzzoni&mdash;at a distance&mdash;for she has not forgotten
Handel&#8217;s threat to throw her out of the
window at the last rehearsal. Also there is the
poet Gay, and Lord Burlington: Her Grace of
Chandos, with her shadow, Mr Pope: Hogarth,
Smollett, and that rogue, Colley Cibber, bursting
with some merry squib, which must be bottled
up until the end of Mr Handel&#8217;s piece, for fear
of rousing that gentleman&#8217;s fiery temper.</p>

<p>Then quite suddenly the crowd fades away,
leaving the lonely figure at the harpsichord.
The outline has grown very faint, yet one can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
discern that it is the master still; older, gentler,
feebler, with eyes that gaze, but cannot see.
Genius is still the dominating power, neither
age nor infirmity can destroy it. The groping
fingers continue to pour forth that exquisite
flow of music, which is with us now and will
remain always, for his name is</p>

<div class="verse">One of the few immortal names</div>
<div class="verse">That were not born to die.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Turning away from the many interesting
memories revived by the old harpsichord, we
discover that we have turned our backs on a
case of Asiatic instruments clustering round a
double-bass of such ample proportions that it
is impossible to ignore it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Giant&#8221;&mdash;as the monster is aptly called&mdash;is
massive in every way. It is tall&mdash;nearly
ten feet&mdash;it is broad, stout, and, in addition
to its bulky proportions, exercises a strange
magnetic influence over the gazer. So forcible
is its power, that one is compelled to stay and
meditate beneath its shadow as though it were
still part of the parent tree from which it was
ruthlessly torn some hundred years ago. As
we settle down to view this mighty example of
the perfected form of the violin, stray facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
concerning this instrument and others of its
kind come to us in a hap-hazard fashion. Our
memory is whipped into various whimsical recollections
of big things and fat people. Irresistibly
a reminiscence of the great Lablache is wafted
to us. This gigantic singer was a humble
double-bass in the orchestra of a theatre, in
a small Italian town, before his glorious voice
brought him renown. One evening, as he was
preparing to finger his part in the orchestra, he
heard that the principal bass singer was too
indisposed to sing. Here was the chance of
Lablache&#8217;s life, and&mdash;he took it. He filled the
vacant bass singer&#8217;s part himself and gained such
an instantaneous success that he forsook the
double-bass for ever. Yet, although he discarded
it, he could not quite get rid of its
memory, for his very voice was reminiscent of
its tones. No one noticed this resemblance
more than Weber, who, hearing him a few
months after his début, exclaimed involuntarily:
&#8220;By heavens! he is a double-bass still!&#8221;</p>

<p>As for the biography of the big bass before
us, it is short but honourable. Made in Italy&mdash;that
happy land of <i>lutherie</i>&mdash;it was once the
property of Domenico Dragonetti, who came to
England in 1794 and gathered victorious laurels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
in this country until the day of his death.
Amusing anecdotes are said to have flowed incessantly
from the lips of this whimsical artist,
yet nothing he said surpassed his ridiculous
habit of making up a &#8220;no-language&#8221; out of
several tongues. Although Dragonetti resided
in London for upwards of forty years, yet until
his dying day he could not converse for ten
minutes without running into several different
languages, and when he exchanged opinions
with his bosom friend, Lindley, who stuttered
frantically, the effect defied both description
and imitation. There is a story on record that
Dragonetti and Lindley were one day lounging
down Wardour Street, which was then&mdash;as it is
now&mdash;the haunt of the connoisseur, when they
came upon a shop where, among other attractions,
a parrot was put out for sale. The
friends contemplated the bird for some time
without speaking, until they attracted the attention
of the shopman, who at once came out to
them. Lindley began stumbling out endless
questions to him, for the bird had taken his
fancy, and Dragonetti poked in a query now
and again in his own curious jargon. How old
was the bird? What did it like to eat? Where
did it come from? Was it a clever bird? Was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
it tame? and so on, ending, with a tremendous
effort on Lindley&#8217;s part: &#8220;Ca-ca-can-can he-he-e
et-t-t-talk?&#8221; The salesman, impatient of having
been kept so long to no purpose, felt he would
lose nothing by a little outburst of temper, so he
turned upon his heel with the sarcastic reply:
&#8220;Talk! I should think so, and a jolly sight
better than either of you, or I&#8217;d wring his
blooming neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dragonetti had no rival in his day, though
Bottesini, about half-a-century later, could accomplish
all that Dragonetti did. Indeed he did
more, for he proved what wonderful effects could
be produced by utilising the double-bass as a
solo instrument, whereas Dragonetti was more
particularly an orchestral genius. It is said that
in private, however, he frequently amused his
friends with wonderful flights on one string, or
jocularly played a second violin part in a Quartet
on his bulky instrument. Like Paganini his disproportionately
long knobby fingers gave him a
wonderful command and grip of the fingerboard,
and he produced a tone like the great rolling
pedal notes of an organ. So vast and penetrating
was its quality, and so spirited his leadership
of the double-basses, that his absence invariably
called forth a comment from the audience on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the weakness of the bass at such-and-such a
concert.</p>

<p>Like Paganini, and many other famous artists,
Dragonetti also possessed a cherished instrument,
from which death alone parted him. The tone
of this beautiful Gasparo da Salo is recorded to
have been immense, and many were the occasions
when its sonorous voice was the means of providing
Dragonetti with the material for perpetrating
one of his practical jokes. On the very
day that the good monks of the monastery of
St Pietro, near Venice, presented him with the
double-bass, his high spirits led him into all kinds
of pranks. Mad with delight at the possession
of such a treasure, he carried it home and seated
himself in the hall, with the bass planted before
him. In response to a few strokes of his bow
the bulky instrument emitted such thunderous
rolling sounds that all the china and glass, even
the pots and pans, began to rattle. Up from the
kitchen department came the frightened inmates,
hardly knowing what to expect, and they found
nothing but&mdash;a slim lad, playing a big fiddle.</p>

<p>Returning to the double-bass before us, we
must admit that the numerous large basses made
in Italy and England, as well as during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, was surprising.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
The conventional mind of the English can rarely
create anything for itself in art, but must for ever
imitate. Thus when they discovered that the
Italian players who came to England used much
larger double-basses than they were accustomed
to, the order went forth at once: &#8220;Make ours
large too!&#8221; The arrival of Gariboldie in London,
in the reign of King George III., was the signal
for much agitation amongst the King&#8217;s musicians,
for it was understood that he was accompanied
by an unusually large double-bass. Mr Nilbone,
the principal bass, was in particular most anxious,
and wrote the following letter to the eminent
maker, William Forster, upon the matter<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right"><i>Windsor, July</i> 4<i>th</i>, 87 [1787].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;By his <i>Majesty&#8217;s</i> order you are to form
a plan for a new double-bass; it is to be at least
four inches wider, if not more, than that which
you made and the depth according. You are to
make it as well as possible&mdash;so as not to let any
exceed it in England&mdash;as Gariboldie has sent
to Italy for an uncommon large one both in goodness
and size by the performance at the Abbey
next year....<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>For what exact purpose these monster instruments
were used it is difficult to surmise, unless for
the amusement of some &#8220;Giants of mighty bone
and bold enterprise.&#8221; Perhaps some descendant
of Anak, Og, or Goliath was the first owner of
this monster; some colossal <i>virtuoso</i> who made
his fellow-artists tremble&mdash;like jelly in a bowl&mdash;when
he arbitrarily forbade them to take their
encores. Certainly the advertisement columns
of <i>The Daily Advertiser</i> some two hundred years
ago contain so many announcements of giants,
that one might easily be led to suppose that
they were a drug in the market at that time.</p>

<p>An account of a bass which must have been
quite as massive&mdash;possibly larger&mdash;as the one
before us is given in his &#8220;Memoirs&#8221; by the
Baron de Pollnitz, an Austrian nobleman, who
visited many courts during the latter part of the
eighteenth century. He received a particularly
gratifying reception at the court of Duke
Maurice of Saxony, whom he discovered to be
an enthusiastic collector of musical instruments,
and more especially of bass-viols. In the following
passage the Baron describes his visit to
the Museum where they were stored:&mdash;&#8220;The
Prince conducted me into a hall which was hung
with bass-viols from the bottom to the top, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the same manner as an arsenal is with helmets
and breastplates. In the middle of the hall was
a viol which was distinguished from all the
rest. It reached up to the very ceiling, and
there was a ladder set, which such as had the
curiosity to take particular view were obliged to
ascend, for surely it was the most stately instrument
of the kind that was ever made. The Duke
made me take particular notice of it, and was
pleased with the admiration I expressed of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In an interview with one of the Duke&#8217;s gentlemen-in-waiting
which followed the reception at
the palace, the Machiavelian-like use to which
this double-bass had been put is revealed with
startling clearness: &#8220;As for my august master,&#8221;
remarks the garrulous courtier, &#8220;his fancy runs
only on bass-viols, and whoever solicits him for
employment or any other favour cannot do better
than accommodate his arsenal with one of these
instruments. That large one which you saw in
the room where all the viols are kept was presented
to him by one who wished to be a Privy
Councillor. His petition was granted, and had
he asked for anything else he might have had
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another huge double-bass is described by
Mr William Gardiner, of Leicester, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
delightfully chatty book, &#8220;Music and Friends.&#8221;
He recounts coming across the monster in his
native town in 1786, and says: &#8220;It was of such
a height that Mr Martin [the maker] was
obliged to cut a hole in the ceiling to let the
head through; so that it was tuned by going
into the room above.&#8221;</p>

<p>If either of these instruments had by chance
found its way to the East, what a sensation
it would have created! The Oriental in all
generations has cherished a fine reverence for
bulk, apparently measuring the intellect by the
dimensions of the body, and this is no doubt
his reason for constructing his gods in such
awe-inspiring proportions. Not only does he
make them large, but he also carefully preserves
the traditional history of his country with which
they are intertwined, and it is interesting to observe
what a goodly part music plays in these
annals. For instance, to the assumed founder
of the Chinese Empire, <small>B.C.</small> 3000, the God
Fohi, called &#8220;The Son of Heaven,&#8221; is assigned
the invention of several stringed instruments,
while their musical scale&mdash;distributed in the
manner of the black notes on the piano&mdash;was
derived from a miraculous bird rejoicing in the
name of Foung-hoang.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>The Brahmin traditions of the Hindus inform
us that the God Nareda invented one of their
most popular instruments now in use&mdash;the vina&mdash;while
speech and musical sounds were the
creation of Brahma&#8217;s amiable and intellectual
consort, Saraswati. Turning to the legendary
history of Ceylon, we again find allusion to
musical invention. The most ancient myth of
this island concerns the doings of Rama&mdash;a
physical incarnation of the God Vichnou&mdash;and
Ravenan, the giant king who is credited with
the difficult achievement of inventing the first
stringed instrument played with a bow, five thousand
years ago. This Ravenan, besides being
of great strength and rejoicing in several heads,
considered himself such a sweet and virtuous
soul, that he established himself as a divinity,
and invited his subjects&mdash;like a hot-pie man&mdash;to
&#8220;gather round.&#8221; The request&mdash;if an arbitrary
command can so be called&mdash;met with a
speedy response. They not only &#8220;gathered
round,&#8221; but they worshipped, and the foolish
giant became exceedingly puffed up. Indeed,
so great was his exaltation when he saw the
growth of his proselytes, that he at length
conceived the plan of making conquests farther
afield. But&mdash;to borrow from Mr Bernard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Shaw&mdash;&#8220;You never can tell.&#8221; You start
scaling the Alps with a high heart, and a
conviction that you will reach the top, when
a nasty avalanche descends upon you and you
are extinguished as easily as a farthing dip.</p>

<p>This was the case with the many-headed
Ravenan. Whether the strain of thinking with
seven heads at a time destroyed his judgment,
or whether he did not think at all but allowed
his conceit to get the better of him, we do not
know, at any rate the avalanche was at hand
in the form of his enemy, Rama. The moment
that God heard of Ravenan&#8217;s intentions, he
cried aloud with Jovelike fury: &#8220;By Brahma,
it shall not be!&#8221; and there and then bore down
upon Ravenan with his army. A great battle
ensued, but alas! to no purpose as far as Rama
was concerned. He was not only routed by
the Cingalese soldiers, but his consort, Sides,
was carried away to the enemy&#8217;s camp. Other
encounters followed the first, but still Ravenan&#8217;s
army conquered. Probably they might have
gained the final victory had not Rama assumed
a Siegfried characteristic. He appealed to
Brahma and obtained from him a magic spear,
with which he ended Ravenan&#8217;s despotic reign.</p>

<p>Of course in these so-called enlightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
days, the Oriental tradition of the ravanastron
(Ravenan&#8217;s invention was named after him) is
laughed down. But after all one must own
the truth of the saying: &#8220;There is no smoke
without a fire,&#8221; and also allow that even the
most poetic fancy must have some species of
realism to give it birth. Possibly this instrument
attributed to Ravenan was but the
&#8220;rushy Zampogna&#8221; alluded to by Sir Roger
North<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> as employed &#8220;to stir up the vulgar to
dance.&#8221; Call it by what name you will, specify
the fingers that made it to be dusky or white,
there is no doubt that our grave and learned
historians of the subject give evidence of the
existence of a stringed instrument played with a
bow in India at a very early date. The first
duty of all historians&mdash;as we know&mdash;is to be
truthful, therefore, when they reiterate the
statement that the fiddle-bow is mentioned in
Sanskrit characters which cannot be less than
two thousand years old, we must believe
implicitly. And then again, we are told that
the description of India&#8217;s musical instruments
found in Sanskrit treatises, reveal that the
forms of the instruments there mentioned, have
scarcely altered during the last thousand years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Here is another point in favour of the ravanastron&#8217;s
Indian origin. Finally, Monsieur Pierre
Sonnerait&mdash;the oft quoted&mdash;in his &#8220;Voyages
aux Indes oriental&#8221; (Paris,
1782), records that this
identical instrument was
then in use among a religious
sect called the
Ponderons.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/fig_001.jpg" alt="RAVANASTRON" /><p class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;<small>RAVANASTRON</small></p></div>


<p>A description of an instrument
bearing a great
similarity to the ravanastron,
which is depicted on
a tall, handled cup belonging
to the collection of
Greek and Etruscan vases
made by Lucien Napoleon,
Prince of Caneno, is to be
found in Mr J. M. Fleming&#8217;s
&#8220;Violins Old and
New&#8221; (London, 1883).
His authority is a reproduction
of the instrument, which he states to
have found in an illustrated catalogue of the
Prince&#8217;s valuable collection, published by subscription
at Milan, in 1836. The scene in which
the instrument figures is printed in red on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
black ground, and reveals a man reading to a
couple of youths who lean upon knotted sticks,
while they listen with great earnestness to the
narrative. On each side of the principal figure
is an object which is
technically termed,
by authorities in
these matters,
&#8220;thecæ&#8221;&mdash;indicating
the profession
of the reader. It
is the form of one
of these &#8220;thecæ&#8221;
that closely resembles
the ravanastron,
and, in addition,
has a bow
placed across the strings startlingly modern in
appearance.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/fig_002.jpg" alt="ANCIENT EGYPTIAN GUITARS" /><p class="caption">Fig. 2<br />

<small>ANCIENT EGYPTIAN GUITARS</small></p></div>

<p>Looked at from a conjectural point of view, one
might hazard that this picture perhaps furthers
the cause of the Indian ravanastron&#8217;s antiquity,
when we bear in mind that the music of the
Sanskrit period closely resembles that of the
Ancient Greeks. The Greeks in their turn&mdash;it
may be remembered&mdash;borrowed their music
from Egypt: the Arabs from Persia: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Chinese from India: Japan from China: and so
on in a merry-go-round of reiteration. This
borrowing system has originated numberless
theories of derivation, but one cannot get away
from the fact that Egypt was the mother country
of musical instruments with stretched strings and
possibly (?) of the bow also. The resemblance
between the ancient Egyptian guitar (Fig. 2) and
the ravanastron (Fig. 1) has easily led to the supposition
that those most accomplished instrumentalists
of ancient times must have discovered the
art of producing sound by friction, although they
have left no proof of any such invention. But&mdash;we
live in an age of discovery&mdash;the most effete
origin of the bow may yet be unearthed, for the
world&#8217;s dust heaps are far from being completely
ransacked. Only the other day a contemporary
newspaper announced that &#8220;Dr von Lecoque,
a scientific emissary of the Persian Government,
has arrived safely at Srinagar [Kashmir], after
a journey through remote parts of Asia. He has
brought with him a quantity of highly interesting
paintings upon stucco, the background in
many cases being of gold-leaf, as in Italian work,
and a number of manuscripts in ten different
languages and one wholly unknown tongue.
Dr von Lecoque&#8217;s discoveries probably constitute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the greatest archæological find since the
days of Layard and Rawlinson.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pending the appearance of further revelations
concerning the origin of stringed instruments
played with a bow, there is no harm in quoting
the following Oriental tale which to some extent
tends to strengthen the invention of the bow
and <i>gut</i> strings in India. The story is to be
found in a Persian work entitled the &#8220;Tute
Nama&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> (&#8220;Tales of a Parrot, or Parrot Book,&#8221;)
written by a Persian author named Nakhshabi,
<small>A.D.</small> 1329, who adapted the romance&mdash;be it
noted&mdash;from a Sanskrit work, now extant.
The frame or leading narrative of the book
deals with a merchant who had a beautiful wife,
but, desiring to increase his wealth by establishing
trade with other countries, he resolved to
travel. His wife, with sweet and womanly
affection, clings to him, and endeavours to dissuade
him from his purpose. But for reply, he
expatiates to her upon the evils of poverty and
the advantages of wealth in a manner that
would delight the heart of &#8220;Major Barbara&#8217;s&#8221;
cynical father &#8220;Andrew Undershaft.&#8221; &#8220;A
man without riches,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is fatherless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and a home without money is destitute.&#8221; Again:
&#8220;He that is in want of cash is a nonentity, and
wanders in the land unknown.&#8221; Other similar
aphorisms greet his gentle wife&#8217;s persuasions,
and at length the matter ends in his departure.
Before leaving, however, he goes to the bazaar
and purchases, at a great cost, a wonderful parrot
that can discourse eloquently, and a species of
nightingale called a &#8220;sharak,&#8221; which can imitate
the human voice in a surprising manner. These
he presents to his spouse as a parting gift,
charging her that she shall consult the birds
and gain their joint consent before transacting
any matter of importance.</p>

<p>Time passes; the merchant&#8217;s wife has bemoaned
her lord&#8217;s absence and conversed with
the birds, until, one day, a handsome foreign
Prince goes by the beautiful lady&#8217;s residence,
and chances to meet the glance of her languishing
eyes. In true Persian fashion, they instantly
fall in love with one another, and the usual
female Mercury of such romances is employed
to arrange a lover&#8217;s meeting. Before keeping
her appointment with the Prince, however, the
merchant&#8217;s wife seeks the counsel of her two
birds, as in duty bound. The &#8220;sharak&#8221; forbids
her to see the Prince at the first suggestion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and is rewarded for her vigilance by getting her
neck wrung. The parrot is next questioned, but
seeing the fate of his companion he prudently
temporises, and commences to tell a tale of such
flattering interest that his mistress forgets to be
angry, and listens, eager and absorbed.</p>

<p>Night after night, the parrot&mdash;in the manner
of Sharazad, who narrated stories for &#8220;A Thousand
and One Nights&#8221;&mdash;eloquently romances,
thus cutely preventing the lady&#8217;s contemplated
intrigue, until the merchant&#8217;s return makes it
impossible. On the fourteenth night the clever
bird entertains his mistress with the following
ingenious theory of the invention of musical
instruments:&mdash;</p>


<p>&#8220;Some attribute ... the discovery to the
sounds made by a large stone against the frame
of an oil-press, and others to meat when roasting,
but the sages of Hind [India] are of opinion
that it originated in the following accident. As
a learned Brahmin was travelling to the court
of an illustrious raja, he rested about the middle
of the day under the shade of a mulberry-tree,
on the top of which he beheld a mischievous
monkey climbing from bough to bough, till by
a sudden slip he fell upon a sharp-pointed shoot
which instantly ripped up his belly, and left his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
entrails suspended on the tree, while the unlucky
animal fell breathless upon the dust of death.
Some time after this, as the Brahmin was returning,
he accidentally sat down in the same place
and, recollecting the circumstance, looked up and
saw that the entrails were dried and yielded a
harmonious sound every time the wind gently
impelled them against the branches. Charmed
at the singularity of the adventure, he took them
down and, after binding them to the two ends of
his walking-stick, touched them with a small
twig by which he discovered that the sound was
much improved. When he got home he fastened
the staff to another piece of wood, which
was hollow, and by the addition of a bow which
was strung with part of his own beard he converted
it into a complete instrument.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In succeeding
ages the science received considerable
improvements. After the addition of a bridge
purer notes were extracted; and the different
students, pursuing the bent of their inclinations,
constructed instruments of various forms according
to their individual fancies; and to this whimsical
accident we are indebted for the tuneful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
<i>ney</i>, and the heart-exhilarating <i>rabáb</i>, and in
short all the other instruments of wind and
string.&#8221;</p>

<p>If we would see this rabab mentioned by our
Persian author, we have but to look on the right-hand
side of the big bass before us, and there
behold the identical thing suspended from a
hook, like a misfit in a tailor&#8217;s shop. But before
we begin discoursing upon its history it would
be as well to glance at the Chinese fiddle, called
the Ur-heen, hanging to the left of the bass.
In shape it is almost the counterpart of the
ravanastron; the same broomstick neck and
fingerboard combined, the same round minute
body. Here, however, the resemblance ends,
for the body of the Chinese instrument is made
of half a cocoanut shell (curiously enough the
monkeys&#8217; favourite repast), covered with gazelle
skin, while the body of the ravanastron&mdash;as
though desiring to accentuate its relationship to
the violin family&mdash;is constructed of a cylinder
of sycamore wood hollowed out. It may be
remembered that M. Fetis, in his &#8220;Notice of A
Stradivari,&#8221; makes a very decisive remark about
the ravanastron: &#8220;If we would trace a bow
instrument to its source,&#8221; says he, &#8220;we must
assume the most simple form in which it could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
appear, and such as required no assistance from
an art brought to perfection, and such a form
we shall find in the ravanastron.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/fig_003.jpg" alt="RABAB" /><p class="caption">Fig. 3.&mdash;<small>RABAB</small></p></div>



<p>Accepting this theory then as our basis, we
must behold in this insignificant-looking construction
(Fig. 1), devoid of classic line or Stradivarius
curve, the progenitor of the violin family&mdash;or,
shall we say: &#8220;The <i>Violoncello</i> family&#8221;? There
is certainly some foundation for giving the
deeper instrument precedence; first: the earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
pitch was low, and, second: if this is doubted,
evidence comes to hand in the primitive stringed
instruments played with a bow being too insecurely
constructed to have borne the pressure
of a tight&mdash;and consequently high-pitched&mdash;string.
Another significant testimony is also
to be found in the tuning of India&#8217;s fiddle,
the sarange. Its highest string does not exceed
middle C, and, besides this, it is held vertically,
like the violoncello.</p>

<p>But we have hung over this thrice-told tale of
India&#8217;s supposed contribution to the history of the
violoncello overlong, we must turn our attention to
the waiting rabab (Fig. 3). Comparing this with
the ravanastron, a glance is sufficient to realise the
development made in the right direction. Here
the length of neck is curtailed, and more attention
given to the sound arrangement. The
outline of the body partakes no more of the
American &#8220;meat-can&#8221; type, and there is an
attempt at assuming those drawn-out corners
and exquisite curves which, under the masterly
touch of Amati and Stradivarius, finally developed
into unassailable perfection. According
to the Persian parrot&#8217;s story, we might be led
to suppose that this was also a Hindu invention,
but it is probably more correct to conclude it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
be the Arab development of the ravanastron, for
truly:</p>



<p class="center">&#8220;... all Arabia breathes from yonder box.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes! Not only does it breathe, but also whispers
of that stalwart race of warriors, awakened
from the lethargy of years and thrilling to
Mohammed&#8217;s sublime cry: &#8220;There is one God
alone!&#8221; speaks of the majestic growth of
civilisation and chivalry among them, which
emanated from the Prophet&#8217;s teaching: tells of
the conquest of Persia in the seventh century,
from whence they gathered wealth and culture,
and of the subsequent subjugation of the whole
of Egypt, Assyria, and India under one vast
Empire. In this manner did the more advanced
knowledge of the vanquished become disseminated
among the conquerors and&mdash;keeping pace
with the newly kindled spirit of progress&mdash;receive
impetus at their hands. The Persian system of
music was taken by the Arabs <i>en bloc</i>; likewise
their musical instruments, and those of India and
Egypt, consequently they became possessed of a
a numerous and varied assortment. Of their
prime favourite <i>el oud</i> (lute), alone, they are said
to have counted thirty varieties, and of stringed
instruments played with a bow they had fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
different types. At the present day, only
two out of this array exist from which to draw
conclusions: the Persian kemangeh à gouze
(ancient place of the bow<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>), and the Arabian
rabab, which was possibly derived from the
Indian ravanastron through the kemangeh.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/fig_004.jpg" alt="KEMANGEH A GOUZE" /><p class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;<small>KEMANGEH A GOUZE</small></p></div>


<p>In the eighth century, the Arabs enlarged their
dominions still further by the addition of Spain,
and it was there more particularly, amid the bewildering
wealth, the luxurious self-indulgence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and unrivalled magnificence, that music&mdash;&#8220;the
language of love&#8221;&mdash;became indispensable.
Mahommed might frown upon the art: might
decry it as a device of the devil; might thunder
that it caused &#8220;hypocrisy to grow in the heart
like as water promoteth the growth of corn,&#8221;
but to no avail, the placid Moslem found some
means of reconciling his love of sweet sounds to
the teachings of his religion. In Cordova, which
was then the capital of Spain, &#8220;from every
balcony in the evening time sounded the tinkling
of lutes, and the melody of voices, so that the
city seemed wreathed in musical airs after the
bazaars were closed and the evening recreation
had begun. The Caliph, secluded from public
curiosity in his voluptuous retreat of Zehra,
passed his hours of recreation amid scenes that
may well recall the description of fable. The
&#8216;pavilion of his pleasures&#8217; was constructed of
gold and polished steel, the walls of which were
encrusted with precious stones. In the midst of
the splendour produced by lights reflected from
a hundred crystal lustres, a sheaf of living quicksilver
jetted up in a basin of alabaster and made
a brightness too dazzling for the eye to look
upon. Amid the decorations of rare and stupendous
luxury was a musical tree&mdash;a similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
construction is said to have existed at Constantinople
and one at Bagdad&mdash;the branches of
which were made of gold and silver. On
eighteen large branches and a number of twigs
beneath them sat a multitude of birds shaped
out of the same precious metals. By an ingenious
mechanism inside the golden tree the birds
were made to sing in a most melodious chorus,
to the delight and amazement of the listeners.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In Bagdad, Cairo, and Damascus there was
the same lavish grandeur, the same magnificence,
and, amid the culture and poetic romanticism,
which was the wonder of all Europe, the prime
instigator to the development of music and
musical instruments&mdash;the minstrel&mdash;sprang into
life. Not only were bands of minstrels kept at
the palaces of the caliphs, princes, and viziers,
but companies of wandering minstrels roamed the
country from city to city and house to house,
everywhere receiving welcome and creating a
fine taste and criticism among the people. No
man was accounted a good minstrel unless&mdash;besides
being able to play sweet melodies, and
jingle bright tunes&mdash;he could utter clever things
with point and clearness of diction: repeat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
endless poetry, both grave and gay: have a
fluent command of speech, and, when singing,
enunciate with perfect purity. All these attributes
they attempted to display and cultivate in
their playing of the dulcimer; their singing to
the accompaniment of the lute; their story
telling, and their chanting to the rabab on
the eternal theme&mdash;love.</p>

<p>Alas! princely race of poets and musicians,
your greatness has vanished like a cloud of
dust. Vanquished and overcome in your turn,
your grandeur, your literature, your science is
a thing of the past, and your dignified minstrel
is to-day but a beggarly sha&#8217;er (poet) who
frequents Egyptian cafés, and, for a paltry
remuneration, chants to the accompaniment of
the rabab. Go to that most cosmopolitan spot
on earth, Cairo, where Greek, Turk, Egyptian,
Persian, and Arabian rub shoulders, and present
an incessant kaleidoscopic vision of brilliant
colours, and there you will meet this minstrel,
remnant of &#8220;Arabian Nights&#8217;&#8221; wonders.
Down the street he comes, stops at a café,
seats himself on the mus&#8217;tub&#8217;ah, or raised seat,
which is built against the front of the coffee-shop&mdash;rabab
in hand, while another performer
on the rabab seats himself beside him to play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
certain parts of the accompaniment. The
auditors occupy the rest of the sha&#8217;er&#8217;s platform,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
or &#8220;arrange themselves on the mus&#8217;tub&#8217;ahs
of the houses on the opposite side of
the narrow street, and the rest sit on stools or
benches made of palm-sticks; most of them
with pipe in hand; some sipping their coffee,
and all highly amused, not only with the story,
but with the lively and dramatic manner of
the narrator.&#8221; After invocating the Prophet&#8217;s
blessing the sha&#8217;er, who both recites and chants
<i>par c&oelig;ur</i>, plays a few introductory notes on
the rabab and then begins to relate the popular
and ancient story of the adventures of Ab&#8217;oo&#8217;
Zey&#8217;dee, which is full of dramatic possibilities
for one gifted with histrionic talent. The
first part of the tale deals with the childhood
of the hero who&mdash;owing to his mother praying
before his birth that he might be brave like a
blackbird whom she saw attack and vanquish
a numerous flock of birds&mdash;was born as black
as night. On account of his sombre hue the
helpless infant is cast upon the world in his
mother&#8217;s arms by his father, who is the chief
of the great tribe of Ben&#8217;ee Hila&#8217;l. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the many situations in which the tale abounds
is the manner in which the mother keeps the
knowledge of his father&#8217;s name from her son,
and incites him to war against his own tribe.
However, everything ends well: the dusky hero
is restored to his own, and the humble sha&#8217;er,
having come to the end of his narration, again
asks the Prophet&#8217;s blessing. The proprietor
of the <i>café</i> gives him a small recompense for
attracting customers, and he departs on his way,
taking with him the feeble glimmer of wonders
faded and gone.</p>

<p>Besides the <i>one</i>-stringed rabab used by the
sha&#8217;er, there is also an identical <i>two</i>-stringed
instrument called rabel ab monghun&#8217;ee, or
singer&#8217;s viol, reserved entirely for the accompaniment
of vocal performances. Both are constructed
of wood, and the resonant body is made
by stretching skin over the four-cornered body
frame. Some of the sounding boxes have no
back, while others have another piece of skin to
form that part.</p>

<p>The charms of the rabab have so completely
usurped our attention that we have neglected
to speak more fully of that undoubtedly ancient
instrument, the Persian kemangeh à gouze
(Fig. 4). As there is perhaps no more delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
or authentic description of this instrument than
that given by Sir William Ouseley, we will quote
the whole extract from his: &#8220;Travels in the
East, particularly in Persia,&#8221; just as it stands:</p>

<p>&#8220;My desire of hearing what the Persians
considered as their best musick, could only be
gratified it is said in the chief cities. Meanwhile
a kind of violin called kemáncheh (or, as
pronounced in the south of Persia, Kamoncheh)
and found in almost every town, afforded me
frequent entertainment. That which I saw first
was in the hands of Mohammed Caraba&#8217;ghi, a
poor fellow who sometimes visited our camps.
His kemáncheh was of <i>tut</i> or mulberry-tree
wood; the body (about eight inches in diameter)
globular except at the mouth, over which was
stretched, and fixed by glue, a covering of parchment;
it had three strings (of twisted sheep&#8217;s-gut)
and a bridge placed obliquely. A straight
piece of iron strengthened the whole instrument
from the knob below, through the handle or
fingerboard to the hollow which received the
pegs. It was carried hanging from the shoulder
by a leather strap; in length it was nearly three
feet from the wooden ball at the top to the iron
knob or button which rested upon the ground.
The bow was a mere switch, about two feet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
a half long, to which was fastened at one end
some black horse-hair. At the other end this
hair was connected by a brass ring with a piece
of leather seven or eight inches long. The ring
was managed with the second and third fingers
of the performer&#8217;s hand and by its means he
contracted or relaxed the bow, which was occasionally
rubbed on a bit of wax or rosin stuck
above the pegs....</p>

<p>&#8220;The performer generally combined his voice
with the tones of his instrument. At the house
of a person in Bushehr, I one day heard another
minstrel sing to his kemáncheh a melancholy
ditty, concerning the ill-fated Zend dynasty
which became extinct on the murder of Luft
Ali Kha&#8217;n in 1794, when the present King&#8217;s
uncle, of the Kajar tribe, assumed imperial
authority. The Zend princes were much beloved....
The elegy on their misfortunes
abounded with pathetic passages, and the tune
corresponding drew tears from some who listened.&#8221;
Later the author informs us that the
kemáncheh is made of various materials: &#8220;I
have seen one of which the body was merely a
hollow gourd; and another of which every part
was richly inlaid and ornamented. Some,&#8221; says
Abd-ul-cadir, &#8220;form the body of this instrument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
from the shell of a cocoanut, fixing on it hair
strings; but many are made from wood over
which they fasten silken strings.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>But! ... but! ... but, surely it is lunch-time!
The sight of the big double-bass and its
Asiatic satellites is becoming very irksome, and&mdash;the
American&#8217;s &#8220;silent sorrow&#8221; is overcoming
us. In plain words: &#8220;We are hungry!&#8221;</p>

<p>Was it not Schopenhauer who said to a
German officer, who watched the philosopher&#8217;s
mighty appetite with astonishment: &#8220;I eat
much, sir, because I have a great mind,&#8221; adding
that thought required vigorous nourishment?
Of course! Then let us enter the spacious
restaurant, guarded by two of Flaxman&#8217;s <i>chefs-d&#8217;&oelig;uvre</i>;
seize a white-robed table; beckon to
a black-robed waiter; and take the food of
thought, <i>à la</i> Schopenhauer.</p>

<p>Lunch, and the Emperor Albinus&mdash;The Crwth&mdash;The immature
Bow Instruments which preceded the Fifteenth-century
Viol&mdash;M. Coutagne and Gaspar Duiffoproucart</p></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> under the shadow of the friendly
double-bass, we were particularly favoured
and aided by the punctuating poke of a finger
at the instruments mentioned. Now, however,
isolated in that inartistic invention&mdash;a Restaurant&mdash;we
have no such aid. There is no inspiration
to be gained from knives and forks, plates and
spoons, unless one be a cutler, a potter, a <i>chef</i>,
or rejoices in the voracious appetite of the
Emperor Albinus. This monarch&mdash;says our
classical dictionary&mdash;thought nothing of devouring
500 figs, 100 peaches, twenty pounds of
dry raisins, 10 melons, and 400 oysters for
breakfast. What the heavier meals of the day
were composed of is a matter upon which we
are left to cogitate.</p>

<p>There is no necessity to dwell upon the
many immature bow instruments which preceded
the fifteenth-century viol, but, for the sake of
context, they must be allowed a passing interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and a glance at these pictures of them, which we
have here upon the table. The Welsh crwth
we will not mention, for it has already been
effectually cast out of the fiddle
family&#8217;s ancestry by an eminent
authority in such matters. Likewise,
for the same reason, we
will pass the rote or rotta, with a
vacant stare.</p>


<div class="figleft"><img src="images/fig_005.jpg" alt="REBEC" /><p class="caption">Fig. 5.&mdash;<small>REBEC</small></p></div>


<p>The rebec,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> however, we will
welcome, for here we tread upon
safe ground. Lying uppermost
upon the table before us is a
sketch (Fig. 5) of this little pear-shaped
instrument which was the
parent of the viol, and the
darling of the minstrel&#8217;s heart.
Its progenitor was the rabab of
Arabia, and it derived its Frenchified
title through the rabab&#8217;s
Spanish equivalent &#8220;rabel,&#8221; or
&#8220;arabel.&#8221; Owing to its commodious size, and
consequent utility, this little instrument diffused
itself rapidly over Europe. To sunny Provence;
to France; to Normandy; and lastly to England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
it went in the hands of Troubadours and Crusaders,
and so great was the charm of its coarse
strings and rotund form, that mankind cherished
it for many centuries. In England it became
quite habitual to look upon the violin and the
rebec as almost the same instrument; so much
so, that the term fiddle became as synonymous
with the rebec as with the violin. Thus we
find Fletcher, in his &#8220;Knight of the Burning
Pestle,&#8221; putting the following speech into the
mouth of one of his characters: &#8220;They say
&#8217;tis present death for these fiddlers to tune their
<i>rebecs</i> before the Grand Turk,&#8221; while &#8220;Golding,&#8221;
in Thomas Shadwell&#8217;s Comedy of &#8220;The Miser,&#8221;
speaks of the Fiddler&#8217;s Violin.</p>

<p>The first instrument played with a bow in
France, the rebec survived longest in that country,
and in the first half of the sixteenth century we find
woodcut representations of it in complete &#8220;sets&#8221;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
<i>soprano</i>, <i>alto</i>, <i>tenor</i>, and <i>bass</i>&mdash;in Martin
Agricola&#8217;s &#8220;Musica Instrumentalis Deudsch.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/fig_006.jpg" alt="SPANISH MINSTREL" /><p class="caption">Fig. 6.&mdash;<small>SPANISH MINSTREL</small> (Eleventh-century MS.)</p></div>


<p>Underneath our rebec picture is quite an ornamental
drawing of a man dancing upon stilts
(Fig. 6), which comes from a Saracen&#8217;s pencil.
This gentleman is a minstrel, and we ought to
admire him, yet the cast of his countenance
has been a severe shock to our cherished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
dreams of the romantic silky haired troubadours
of the past. The picture is taken from a
Spanish MS. of the eleventh century, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of the most valuable of its kind in that
Aladdin&#8217;s cave&mdash;the British Museum&mdash;and is
considered to be the work of a monk of the
monastery of Silos in Bourgos (Old Castille).
The instrument held in the minstrel&#8217;s left hand,
while he nimbly trips upon a &#8220;light fantastic
toe,&#8221; is curious and interesting, for it is in the
nature of a freak. So equivocal is its appearance
that as one looks one might easily be led
into paraphrasing Shakespeare by exclaiming:
&#8220;Is it a <i>rebec</i> that I see before me?&#8221; Certainly
the form resembles that instrument, yet it has
none of its three-stringed simplicity. More
properly speaking, it appears to be a combination
of the guitar and viol system, for, while
the fingers twang the string above, the bow
rubs a drone accompaniment beneath. How
much of this arrangement is due to the fancy
of the artist, and how much to truth, it is
impossible to surmise, but certain it is that this
is not the only specimen of a combination
musical instrument to be found amongst the
Arabs. The learned and industrious Michael
Prætorius, in his &#8220;Theatrum Instrumentorum&#8221;
(Wolfenbüttel, 1620), gives two views of an
Arabian instrument which he calls a Monocordum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
and pipe. In form it is identical with
the rabab (Fig. 3) but the neck serves the
double office of fingerboard and reed, so that
the performer could play both instruments at
one and the same time. One cannot help
regretting that this invention has passed out
of use, as it would surely be welcome to those
weary hosts and hostesses of modern times who
ceaselessly strive to &#8220;cut down&#8221; the expenses
of the inevitable music at the inevitable &#8220;At
Home.&#8221; The artist would play solos upon his
combined flute and viol among the clattering
tongues and tea-cups, and the fee for his
services would work out in the following
satisfactory manner:&mdash;One artist + two musical
instruments = One Fee. Excellent!</p>

<p>Beneath the minstrel in his elaborate stockings
lies a picture of a comfortable, pleasant-looking
old gentleman wearing a crown upon his
head, and scraping what looks uncommonly like
an attempt at the Stradivarius model. This
figure (Fig. 7) taken from a bas-relief which
was once in the Chapel of St Georges de
Boscerville, Normandy&mdash;built in 1066&mdash;and
now preserved in the museum at Rouen, is
perhaps the oldest known representation of such
a shaped viol extant. Monsieur Fetis, speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
of this figure in his &#8220;Histoire General de la
Musique,&#8221; describes it as a &#8220;two-stringed
rubebe held between the knees of the person
who plays upon it with a bow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the archæologist who seeks for truth
among the relics of ancient musical instruments
is greeted with serious difficulties. He finds on
one side of him a &#8220;mountain
of names,&#8221; and on the other
side of him a &#8220;mountain of
musical instruments.&#8221; In his
hand he grasps bewildering
allusions to these in poetry and
prose, while sculptural representations,
pictures, and drawings
flit before his eyes. He
holds a bit here, in his endeavour
to unite the mountains,
snatches a fragment there, and
thus it is that we find so many
contradictory assertions among authorities on
the subject.</p>

<p>Monsieur Laurent Grillét asserts that this
Boscerville instrument is not a rubebe, as
Monsieur Fetis says, but a rote, while the
latter&#8217;s theory that the rote was a direct descendant
of the lyre, and was played by plucking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the strings, has been borne out by Mr Heron
Allen. An authority of the period, Jerome of
Moravia, who wrote his &#8220;De cæntiâ Artes
Musiciea&#8221; in 1274, and dedicated it to Gregory
X., speaks of the rubebe as a two-stringed instrument
played with a
bow and tuned thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/music_p_050.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Unfortunately
he does not illustrate
his text, but the depth
of pitch given by him
would indicate an instrument
of larger proportions
than the one
held by the Boscerville
figure. In any case,
whether this be the instrument
indicated by
Jerome or not, he has
distinctly described the
existence of a bass species of viol at that date,
and our next picture might certainly be taken
as an illustration of his description, giving
licence of course, to the third string. This
bas-relief in marble (Fig. 8) is preserved in
the museum at Cologne, and, looked at with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
a twentieth-century eye, is wonderfully replete
with omens. Observe the bridge and its
position: the sound holes in their approved
place: the manner in which the sounding-board
joins the neck: the excellent fingerboard and
tailpiece. All these items, combined with its
size, might easily allow it to be the rubebe of
Jerome de Moravia and if one supposes this to
be so, it is not amiss to suggest that the Boscerville
instrument is also a rubebe, which experience
enlarged in the following century to the
size before us.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to add further examples,
as these three give a fairly broad idea of the
progressive attempts at a definite form, from
about the eleventh to the end of the fourteenth
century. During this period there were doubtless
no hard and fast rules for tuning. The
minstrel adapted the pitch of his instrument
according to whim, or the compass of his voice.
He danced and sang to his own improvised
accompaniments. Thus we hear in 1391 of:
&#8220;Un nommeé Isembart jouait d&#8217;une rubèbe, et,
en jouant, un nommé Le Bastard se print à
danser,&#8221; and again in 1395, &#8220;Roussel et
Gaygnat preurent à jouer, l&#8217;un d&#8217;une fluste
l&#8217;autre d&#8217;une rubèbe, et ainsi que les aulcuns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
dansoient.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The minstrel&#8217;s person and attainments
were undoubtedly of a genial character,
yet with all due deference to his merry ways,
and the good service he rendered to poetry and
music, one cannot help observing that his
dancing and warbling were the means of retarding
the development of musical instruments to a
certain extent. If you roam the country with
your musical equipment upon your back you
naturally require something of a portable size.
&#8220;A fiddle under my cloak?&#8221; says the indignant
Sir Roger l&#8217;Estrange in defending himself
against Mr Bagshawe&#8217;s insinuations that he
frequently solicited private conferences from
Oliver Cromwell with a fiddle under his cloak;
&#8220;Truly my fiddle is a bass-viol, and that&#8217;s somewhat
a troublesome instrument under a cloak.&#8221;
The minstrel of the Middle Ages was certainly
of the same opinion, and was careful that his
fiddle should not assume alarming proportions.
He was content so long as he could carry it
about with ease like &#8220;Gervais de Nevers&#8221; who:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="pindent3">&mdash;&#8220;donned a garment old</div>
<div class="verse">And round his neck a viol hung</div>
<div class="verse">For cunningly he played and sung.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>Another obstacle to the progress of stringed
instruments was placed in their way by the
early contrapuntists who expended their genius
entirely upon vocal music. Thus it was that no
one appeared to realise that a resonant bass-viol,
answering to the pitch of the bass voice, could be
constructed by enlarging the rebecs and embryo
viols then in use. Not until the middle of the
fifteenth century did anything of the sort appear,
and when it did, it came at the imperative call
of the part-songs then coming into vogue. The
singers of these compositions demanded to be
kept in tune just as much as the warblers of
sweet melodies had required, and it was the
desire to do this to the best advantage that led
eventually to the construction of complete sets
of stringed instruments played with a bow and
answering in pitch to the treble, alto, tenor,
and bass voices.</p>

<p>And now, if you have finished your coffee,
shall we return to our case of Asiatic instruments?
There is to be found amongst them
a mongrel species of bass instrument, which
certainly acted in no mean way as a factor in
the development of low-pitched instruments
played with a bow. We allude to the <i>trummelscheit</i>,
known in England under the ambiguous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
title of marine trumpet. It carries one short
gut string tuned to CC, and when correctly
played&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> harmonically&mdash;gives out a scale
corresponding in pitch to that of the high
soprano voice.</p>

<p>This <i>trummelscheit</i> before us is rather undersized.
Its form and construction are of an
advanced type, for besides the short gut string
it has the additional sympathetic wire strings
piercing the body like a delicate bundle of
nerves. Broadly speaking, this instrument was
probably made in France in the days when
aristocracy prospered, and danced stately
minuets at the court of &#8220;Le Grand Monarch&#8221;:
when that cultured son of <i>tapisier</i>, Molière,
wrote his immortal <i>comedies</i> for the amusement
of the <i>haute monde</i>, and Jean Baptiste Lully&#8217;s
impudence and genius placed him upon the
highest pinnacle of fame. The intriguing Jean
Baptiste&mdash;whom Boileau denounced as a <i>coquin
tenebreaux</i>, a <i>c&oelig;ur bas</i>, and a <i>bouffon odieux</i>&mdash;was
possessed of talents which quite equalled his
gifts as a composer of operas. He could write
such divine inspirations as &#8220;Bois Epais&#8221;: could
revolutionise the &#8220;<i>ballet de la cour</i>&#8221; by the
introduction of the pirouette and sprightly
allegro: could play the fiddle to perfection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and conduct his band of &#8220;<i>Petits Violons</i>&#8221; in
a manner to make them quickly famous. He
could pen mischievous verse; take advantage of
court squabbles and turn them to good account,
and used his histrionic gifts to the most satisfactory
ends. Many a time did Lully&#8217;s impersonations
of the exquisitely comic situations
in which Molière delighted to place his characters,
obtain for him the King&#8217;s pardon when his
Majesty had been fairly exasperated by the
unscrupulous actions of his &#8220;<i>Surintendant de la
Musique</i>.&#8221; The polygamy scene in <i>M. de
Pourceaugnac</i> was one of Maître Lully&#8217;s most
effective parts for this purpose, and it is easy to
imagine how the ludicrous perplexities of M.
Jourdain in <i>Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme</i><a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> must
have been interpreted by a man who had himself
risen from obscurity to wealth and fame.
It is in the latter witty comedy that we hear of
the trumpet marine and its position at that time.
Bewildered M. Jourdain&#8217;s music-master is advising
him to give concerts twice a week at his
house.</p>

<p>Laissez-nous gouverner les choses.</p></blockquote>

<p>In spite of Molière&#8217;s just, or unjust ridicule,
the marine trumpet figured in the royal band of
Louis XV. Several names of artists who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
played this instrument at the French court are
recorded in the <i>État de la France</i> for 1702,
and among them we find Danican Philidor, a
favourite musician of Louis, &#8220;le bien aimé&#8221; (?)
and as rampant a chess player as was his contemporary
Diderot. Whether from motives
of economy or because the marine trumpet was
looked upon as &#8220;no great shakes&#8221; (as our
Yankee cousins say), all players of that instrument
at the French court were also performers
on a species of hautbois&mdash;now obsolete&mdash;called
the Cremorne. How these virtuosi managed to
juggle notes out of both instruments at the
same time, history does not relate, but in the
face of such a feat as that achieved by Don
Jumpedo, who nightly jumped down his own
throat at the Little Theatre in the Haymarket
some hundred years ago, all things seem
possible.</p>

<p>England was not behind France in her use of
the marine trumpet. Gay King Charles would
have all things at court in accordance with the
French fashion, and the marine trumpet doubtless
found its way to the British coast in the
company of truffles, perruques, pirouettes, and
long-ear&#8217;d puppy dogs. Whether it was
bundled in with the Cremorne, as was its fate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
in France, or ignored, as in Italy, is not recorded,
but its advent was apparently announced in the
following stirring advertisement published in <i>The
London Gazette</i> for 4th February 1674:&mdash;&#8220;A
rare concert of Trumpets Marine, never before
heard of in England. If any persons desire to
come and hear it they may repair to the Fleece
Tavern near St James&#8217; about two of the clock
in the afternoon every day in the week except
Sundays. Every concert shall continue one
hour and so begin again. The best places are
one shilling and the other sixpence.&#8221; The
marine trumpet was not only a means of drawing
the public, but it apparently had a market
value of its own, for we find in Thomas Shadwell&#8217;s
play, <i>The Miser</i>, of that period, that
a certain loan includes a &#8220;Bolona lute, a roman
Arch lute, 2 gittars, a Cremona Violin, a Lyra
Viol, 1 Viol da Gambo, and a Trumpet-Marine,
very fit for you if you be a lover of musick.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/fig_009.jpg" alt="MARINE TRUMPET" /></div>

<p class="caption">Fig. 9.&mdash;<small>MARINE TRUMPET</small></p>

<p>But it was in Germany&mdash;the scene of the
trumpet marine&#8217;s birth&mdash;that it found its real
vocation. In that land of sausages and romance,
beer and love sonnets, it was known under the
double title of &#8220;Trummelscheit&#8221;&mdash;from its resemblance
to a sword sheath&mdash;and &#8220;Nonnen-Trompett,&#8221;
for the reason that the nuns themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
employed it in their convents. The
delicate lips of the fair <i>religeuses</i> were unable
to cope with the mouth-distorting horn; yet
they required an instrument of that type to add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
vigour to their heaven-sent praises. Their
difficulty was in reality not unlike that of the
German bassoon player, Schubert, when Baumgarten
commanded him at rehearsal to sustain
a certain note. &#8220;It is very easy for you, Mister
Baumgarten, to say, hold out that note,&#8221; replied
he quietly, &#8220;but who is to find the vind?&#8221;
The wind instruments must have their human
bellows, but these being weak, the marine trumpet
became a substitute for the horn, and every
German cloister was furnished with, and employed,
a nonnen-trompett or nonnen geige.
Until almost the end of the eighteenth century,
this quaint custom continued, after which the
nuns apparently grew bolder and fearlessly attacked
double-basses and violoncellos and whole
orchestras of instruments. Kastner, writing at
the beginning of the nineteenth century, says:
&#8220;All who go to Lichtenthal near Baden can
hear the nuns of the convent of this name sing
divine service with an orchestral accompaniment
in which many of them took part,&#8221; which proves
that even at that date the custom of supplying
their own music had not been excluded from
convent life.</p>

<p>How the marine trumpet or trumpet marine
came to be so called is a riddle that possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
finds its solution in the form of the instrument
itself. The shape in its earliest form resembled
the long speaking-trumpet familiar to sailors.
Thus we can account for the nautical touch
which is given to this instrument by the first
half of its title, while the trumpet part must be
engendered by the <i>timbre</i> produced by the ingenious
arrangement of the bridge. One does
not often find the correct bridges on the existing
marine trumpets. To be accurate, the
bridge should be made of wood in the form of
a shoe. The heel part should be attached to
the table of the instrument and the gut string
passed over it, while the toe part should rest
unattached upon a little square of inlaid ivory
or glass. The toe acts like the <i>bâton</i> of the
<i>chef-d&#8217;orchestre</i>; each throb of the pulsating
string is faithfully translated by a tap upon the
ivory or glass when the player sets the string
in vibration with his bow. It is this ingenious
arrangement that contrives to give a sonorous
burring&mdash;associated with the sound of brass
instruments&mdash;to the harmonies of the marine
trumpet. Mr E. J. Payne, who wrote the able
article upon this instrument in Sir George
Grove&#8217;s &#8220;Dictionary of Music and Musicians&#8221;
(first edition), there says: &#8220;The facility with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
which the marine trumpet yields its natural
harmonies is due to its single string and its
lop-sided bridge. Paganini&#8217;s extraordinary effects
in harmonics on a single string were in fact produced
by temporarily converting his violin into
a small marine trumpet. As is well known, that
clever player placed his single fourth string on
the treble side of the bridge, screwing it up to
a very high pitch, and leaving the bass foot of
the bridge comparatively loose. He thus produced
a powerful reedy tone and obtained unlimited
command over the harmonics.&#8221;</p>

<p>Michael Praetorius, writing in 1620, gives a
good deal of interesting information about the
marine trumpet. He says that its ancient origin
is undoubted: that the roaming musicians played
upon it in the streets; and plasters it with faint
praise by remarking that, &#8220;its tone was more
agreeable at a distance than close to it.&#8221; Marin
Mersenne, most exact and careful critic, scribbling
in Paris sixteen years later, discusses this
instrument lengthily. In the course of his remarks&mdash;which
are full of interest&mdash;he mentions
that the marine trumpet was very difficult to
play for the reason (oh! mark this, ye modern
violoncellists of the dexterous digits) that it was
necessary to move the <i>thumb</i> or another finger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
with swiftness. &#8220;I have no doubt,&#8221; he adds,
&#8220;that one could not play it perfectly until one
had studied it as long as the lute or viol.&#8221;
Mersenne&#8217;s allusion to the <i>thumb</i> movement of
course speaks for itself, still, it is interesting to
note more particularly that the <i>movable thumb</i>
was employed by marine trumpet virtuosi long
before it was ever included in the technique of
the violoncello. The genius of Berteau was the
means of introducing thumb movement as a
special aid to the high positions on the violoncello,
in the first half of the eighteenth century;
until then the fingerboard over the belly remained
unknown. Truly there is nothing new
to be discovered! Here was the modern violoncellist&#8217;s
particular recourse in use probably a century
or so before he became slightly acquainted
with it as a <i>novelty</i>, at the beginning of the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, and end the tale
of the marine trumpet, we will briefly outline
its origin. In ancient times it was nothing more
nor less than the monochord, an instrument, as
we know, invented by Pythagoras of Samos, for
measuring musical sounds, <small>B.C.</small> 530. When he
departed this life, this learned Greek exhorted
his disciples to &#8220;strike the monochord&#8221; and thereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
rather inform their understandings than trust
to their ears in the measurement of intervals.
His followers and pupils not only hearkened, but
performed, and thus from century to century
the monochord was preserved. It acted as bass
to the rebecs of the Middle Ages; it replaced the
horn in the German convents; it originated the
thumb movement; and eventually suggested the
big &#8220;Geiges&#8221; which came into vogue in Germany
in the first half of the sixteenth century. From
the pictures and descriptions of these &#8220;Geiges&#8221;
given by authorities of the period, the earliest
were made in two kinds&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> those with bridges
and those without. Both appear in complete
quartets, and both were provided with six or
more strings. With the bridgeless &#8220;Geiges,&#8221;
or viols, we may adopt Toole&#8217;s remark about
China in one of his inimitable impersonations.
&#8220;China,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is divided into two parts,
China proper and China improper. With the
latter we will, of course, have nothing to do.&#8221; As
a matter of fact we don&#8217;t want to have anything
to do with these bridgeless viols or &#8220;Geiges,&#8221;
because in our heart of hearts we feel very
dubious as to their existence. Though we may
tremble when we say it, we instinctively assign
their creation to some <i>facile</i> artist long since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
passed away. Either this erring gentleman forgot
to sketch the bridge or else these&mdash;so-called&mdash;bridgeless
viols were nothing more nor less than
big guitars beside which the officious delineator
added a bow. In any case we will dispense with
them and hasten to that immediate predecessor of
the violoncello, the viola da gamba, a leg viol, which
was known all over Europe by its Italian name.</p>

<p>To begin with the makers of these and their
kind, we find the earliest known names are those
of Hans Frey, and Jean Ott, who worked in
Nuremberg in the first half of the fifteenth
century. It may be remembered that Nuremberg
was at that time one of the most active commercial
centres in Europe, and in addition fostered all
the talent and intellect of the day. Within its
precincts dwelt the poetic cobbler, Hans Sachs,
penning his four thousand master songs, his
numberless comedies and tragedies, and making
slippers for dainty Eva besides. Then there was
Adam Kraft, modelling his limestone tabernacle
in the Church of Lawrence, and Peter Vischer,
the brass worker&mdash;and Albert Dürer. Before
this illustrious name we pause, for he himself,
we believe, played the viol, while the viols to be
found in his paintings are doubtless most accurately
portrayed for&mdash;was not Hans Frey the viol-maker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
his father-in-law? It is said that Hans
Frey amassed considerable wealth in his native
town, but his affluence was certainly not due
entirely to the patronage of his viol-playing
clientèle, for we know that he was a &#8220;respected
citizen skilled in all things,&#8221; and that not the
least of his accomplishments was his skill in
copper repoussé work. Many are the decorative
figures, tankards, cake moulds, and other characteristic
designs which owe their existence to
his expert fingers. How redolent are they of
guilds, master-singers, rules, institutions, and all
the elephantine conceit and narrow-mindedness
which went to make the life of the middle-class
Nuremberg citizen!</p>

<p>After Hans Frey and Jean Ott we hear of
Joan Kerlino who, according to Fetis, worked
at Brescia, in Lombardy, in 1449. A &#8220;viola
da Braccio,&#8221; or arm viol, of his making was in
the possession of a Parisian <i>luthier</i> named
Koliker, in 1804, mention of which had been
made by De Laborde in his &#8220;Essai sur la
Musique&#8221; some twenty-five years previously.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Herr von Wasielewski traces Kerlino&#8217;s name to
a German origin, assuming that he settled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Brescia and founded a school there. If this
most probable assertion be true, then it follows,
&#8220;as does the night the day,&#8221; that the Italian
viola family owes its creation to Germany.
Notwithstanding Germany&#8217;s precedence in the
matter of originating the viol form, it is curious
to note that the earliest known book in which
a picture of a viol is to be found is that by
Carmine Angurelli, which was published in
Vienna in 1491, just forty-three years after the
German Kerlino is said to have been making
viols in Brescia. A copy of the little work is
in the British Museum, and the woodcut of a
seven-stringed viol which graces its title-page
is a type ahead of its time.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It is quite equal
to the viols shown in Hans Judenkünig&#8217;s &#8220;Ein
schöne Kunstliche Underwaisung,&#8221; published in
Vienna thirty years later, and far in advance
of any representation of a viol in Martin Agricola&#8217;s
&#8220;Musica Instrumentalis,&#8221; which appeared
in 1528. The form of Angurelli&#8217;s viol has
much more grace than the German &#8220;Geiges&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of that date. There are no upper bouts, the
curve from the joint of the neck sweeps straight
down to the lower bouts, a shape, by-the-by,
adopted for his grand old tenors by Gasparo
da Salo, the Brescian maker, at a later date.
The head of the viol is square, it has seven
pegs, and one which projects at the side of
the head and supports two more strings. The
bridge is well delineated, and is almost identical
with the familiar form now to be seen on every
violoncello; moreover, it stands in the right place
and not close to the short tailpiece as we find
in Dürer&#8217;s pictures. The sound-holes are in the
primitive C form, also freely used by Da Salo,
and the tailpiece is a facsimile of that employed
in the middle of the following century. Perhaps
the most puzzling part of the picture is the
bow which hangs on a peg beside this viol,
for it is even of a more advanced type than
the viol itself. Does this woodcut represent
the consummation of Kerlino&#8217;s work in Italy,
or is this viol and bow but one of those freaks
of fancy which leap the bounds of an artist&#8217;s
idealism and suddenly appear in completeness,
as did Minerva from Jupiter&#8217;s ingenious brain?
Whichever the case may be, we have in this
picture the earliest woodcut representation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
a viola da gamba extant, and to those who
enthuse over these things we say: &#8220;Look at it
in the works where it is to be found!&#8221; (p. 67 <i>f</i>).</p>

<p>After Kerlino there was a famous performer
on the lute in Germany, named Hans Gerle,
who made stringed instruments, and contributed
to the literature of musical instruments by writing
his &#8220;Musica Teusch,&#8221; which was published
in 1532. In 1500 we find the monk, Pietro
Dardelli, making viols in Mantua, while Ventura
Linarolli was likewise occupied in Venice in
1520, and Peregrino Zanetti was busy in
Brescia in 1540. Morglato Morello was also
a diligent craftsman in Mantua in 1550, and
Gaspard Duiffoproucart was making beautiful
viols, lutes, and chittaras at Lyons in 1558.</p>

<p>Until Dr Henry Coutagne published his
&#8220;Gaspard Duiffoproucart et les Luthiers Lyonnaise,&#8221;
in Paris in 1893, Choron and Fayolle&#8217;s
version of this maker&#8217;s life which appeared in
their &#8220;Dictionnaire historique des Musiciens,&#8221; in
1810, was pretty generally accepted. According
to the latter authorities, Duiffoproucart was born
in the Tyrol at the end of the fifteenth century,
and worked in Boulogna. He was supposed
to have travelled in Germany before settling
definitely in Boulogna in 1515, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Francis I. visited that town he made Duiffoproucart
a handsome offer to accompany him to
France. The King&#8217;s proposition proving tempting,
Duiffoproucart is said to have accepted it,
and made many viols for the musicians belonging
to the court orchestras. But apparently the
air of Paris did not suit the good viol-maker.
His health suffered, and for this reason he
obtained leave to settle in Lyons.</p>

<p>Like a bolt from the blue, however, Dr
Coutagne, bristling with authentic documentary
evidence, has refuted the whole story. Through
his careful research we learn that Duiffoproucart
was born at Freising in Upper Bavaria in 1514:
that he established himself in Lyons about the
middle of the sixteenth century: that Henry II.
of France granted him his &#8220;<i>Lettres de naturalité</i>&#8221;
in 1558, and that he died in Lyons in 1570,
leaving several children, among whom one son
followed his father&#8217;s profession.</p>

<p>Thus has the life of the Lyons viol-maker
confined itself into reasonable limits at last, and
instead of our imagining him settling in Boulogna,
a young man full of ambition, in 1515, we now
picture him at that date in long clothes, felicitously
celebrating his first birthday; all of which
has a tint of an Æsop fable about it which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
most attractive. But there is something even
of greater interest than the satisfactory establishment
of this maker&#8217;s career by the aid of document
and script, and that is&mdash;his much-discussed
portrait which is in the Bibliothèque National in
Paris. This picture was engraved in Lyons by
Pierre W&oelig;iriot in 1562, and is supposed to have
been copied from the original portrait, which
graced the back of one of Duiffoproucart&#8217;s own
viols. At the base of the picture the maker&#8217;s
name is inscribed and spelt thus: &#8220;Duiffoprougcar,&#8221;
which, by the way, is the most familiar form,
but according to M. Coutagne is incorrect orthography.
Under the name are two Latin lines
which we shall have reason to refer to later, and
then follows: &#8220;æta. ann. XLVIII,&#8221; and the
date: &#8220;1514.&#8221; The true meaning of these
words and figures remained a puzzle until Dr
Coutagne solved it by discovering that the
Roman figures indicated the age of the maker to
be forty-eight at the date of the publication
of the engraving, in 1562, while the Arabian
figures give the year of his birth, 1514.</p>

<p>If we were compelled to rely entirely upon
this engraving for evidence of the number of
viola da gamba made by Duiffoproucart, we
might be led to imagine that he had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
made such an instrument in his life. The
artist has represented him as a man of fine
physique, surrounded by various specimens of
small viols, lutes, and guitars, but no sign of a
bass-viol is visible. Notwithstanding the artist&#8217;s
omission, however, three&mdash;if not four&mdash;of this
maker&#8217;s viola da gamba are in existence, and if
we would see one of these we have not far to
go. Indeed, here close beside us, guarded by
the policeman&#8217;s watchful eye, is a specimen of
Duiffoproucart&#8217;s skill (p. 74). It hangs in a good
light and its glass house exposes every side of it to
view. The property of Sir George Donaldson,
there is no doubt but what he has a very unique
possession in this singular little bass-viol. Its
small proportions suggest an exceptionally large
knee viol (originally it was doubtless a very
large tenor-viol called in France, Quinte) or an
instrument especially constructed for use in
church processions. The deep brown varnish,
with a glint of red in it, is particularly good, and
adds to the elegance of the outline and <i>tout
ensemble</i> of the viol. The front is free from
ornamentation but the back bears an inlaid
design, in coloured woods, of a saint and an
angel. Round the edges and in the upper part
there is an interlaced design of flowers. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
peg-box is surmounted by a horse&#8217;s head well
carved, while the fingerboard is also inlaid in
coloured woods and bears the Latin inscription
so indelibly associated with this maker:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Viva fui in Sylvis: fui dura occisa securi</div>
<div class="verse">Dum vixi tacui: Morte Dulce cano.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>and his particular mark is on the back where
the neck joins the ribs. This instrument belonged
to the Parisian <i>luthier</i>, M. Chardon,
before it became the property of Sir George
Donaldson, and, while in the hands of its
former owner, aided in identifying the famous
viola da gamba, by the same maker, now reposing
in the Musée Instrumental of the Brussels
Conservatoire. This beautifully inlaid specimen&mdash;known
as the &#8220;<i>basse de la ville de Paris</i>,&#8221;
owing to the fifteenth-century plan of the gay city
which adorns the back&mdash;is slightly longer than
Sir George Donaldson&#8217;s, though its dimensions
are smaller than those finally adopted for the
violoncello. It has had an adventurous career,
this viol, belonging successively to M. Roquefort,
M. Raoul&mdash;an enthusiastic Parisian musical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
amateur, who published several compositions for
the violoncello as well as a method for that instrument&mdash;and
also to the mighty fiddle-maker, J. B.
Vuillaume. At the death of the latter it went
through many vicissitudes and wandered about
Russia, passing through several hands. M.
Coutagne describes the beauties of this graceful
viola da gamba so accurately and delightfully
that we cannot do better than quote his words:</p>

<p>&#8220;One is at first struck by the richness and
variety of the decoration,&#8221; says he. &#8220;The
neck curves forward at the top in the form of
a horse&#8217;s head of goodly proportions, but the
back of this is covered with delicate and complicated
carvings representing the head of a
woman, a satyr playing a Pan&#8217;s pipes, the whole
being framed in designs of animals, fruit and
musical instruments. The peg-box itself is
covered with carved encrustations of a woman
playing a lute; a dog attached by a collar, and
other ornamentation.</p>

<p class="caption">VIOLA DA GAMBA<br />
<span class="smcap">By Gaspard Duiffoproucart</span>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>&#8220;The upper table is of pine, the back and the
ribs are of maple. The front is covered with
a dull red varnish, that of the rest of the
instrument is clear yellow. A similar contrast
is observable in the character of the two tables.
The front is covered with representations of
butterflies, and bunches of roses, and carnations
in a pot: some birds on a branch and a building
of varied shapes, remarkable for a tower and a
Chinese pagoda: briefly, a design in the decorative
Dutch style of the seventeenth century.
The back, on the contrary, is covered with a
complicated <i>marqueterie</i> design in multi-coloured
woods. The whole of the upper part is taken
up with a scene which is apparently inspired by
Raphaël&#8217;s &#8216;Vision of Ezekiel&#8217;; it represents a
profile of St Luke seated upon an ox and being
raised in the air towards the clouds from whence
angels are seen blowing trumpets. Below this
is an unpretentious plan of a good-sized town
situated by a stream dotted with islands and
surrounded by walls; more than two hundred
houses measure at the most half-a-square-inch,
other edifices constitute the background of
this picturesque decoration, where some microscopic
figures of men also appear. Inscribed
beneath is the name, &#8216;Paris,&#8217; and we have
found an almost identical plan, dated 1564, at
the Bibiothèque Nationale. To complete the
description of this inlaying we must mention
several bunches of flowers which encircle the
principal subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. Coutagne says that this viol shows signs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of recutting and also attempts to change the
C-shaped sound-holes into the <i>f</i> form, now so
familiar to the eye of the connoisseur and
<i>virtuoso</i>. The absence of any name signature
to this viol, and the marked difference of workmanship
and colour observable between the
front table and the rest of the viol, caused
several experts to doubt its authenticity until
it was placed side by side with this viola da
gamba of Sir George Donaldson&#8217;s. Then the
incontestable evidence given by the close resemblance
existing between the two instruments
at once allayed all doubts as to the authenticity
of the back, head, neck and ribs of the &#8220;<i>basse
de la ville de Paris</i>.&#8221; The front, however, with
its dull red varnish and painted design never
felt the touch of Duiffoproucart&#8217;s hand. Beyond
a doubt this is of English manufacture: and
more than possibly the work of seventeenth-century
Barak Norman.</p>

<p>Can anything be more <i>bizarre</i> than this
union of the work of good John Bull Norman
and Lorraine Duiffoproucart? Imagine such
methods applied to other beautiful and valuable
works of art, and we might come across such
incongruities as, Cleopatra&#8217;s Needle nicely
finished off with a druidical stone, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
statue of Wellington supporting Napoleon&#8217;s
head upon its shoulders, or Raphaël&#8217;s beautiful
madonnas seated upon Chesterfield couches: one
might go on endlessly summing up such horrors
were vandalism a ruling power, but fortunately
it is not; even the remotest cottage dweller
now knows the value of his various household
gods, and only parts with them &#8220;at a
price.&#8221;</p>

<p>The third example of Duiffoproucart&#8217;s work is
known as the &#8220;<i>basse de viole au Vieillard à la
chaise d&#8217;Enfant</i>.&#8221; A drawing of this instrument
by M. Hellemacher is included in M. Vidal&#8217;s
&#8220;Instrument à Archet&#8221; (Paris, 1876-78), and
M. Soubie also gives a clear representation of
it in his &#8220;Histoire de la Musique Allemande&#8221;
(Paris 1896). In form and size, this viola da
gamba resembles the two already mentioned.
It is small, the same horse&#8217;s head surmounts the
peg-box, and the picture on the back is said
to have been copied from a design of Baccio
Dardinelli, which was engraved by Duiffoproucart&#8217;s
contemporary, Augustin Venetien. The
inlaying is in the characteristic style of the
maker, in several coloured woods. The fourth
gamba by this maker&mdash;according to Monsieur
Chardon&mdash;exists in Switzerland and completes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the number of known examples of violas da
gamba by this maker.</p>

<p>Not many yards away from this graceful
Duiffoproucart viol of Sir George Donaldson&#8217;s
is a viola da gamba of strikingly beautiful workmanship.
The inlaying is exquisitely rich in
ivory and tortoise-shell, reminiscent of the
luxurious decorations lavished by past makers
on that much-treasured instrument&mdash;the lute.
As you gaze at this viol&#8217;s profuse charms, you
are seized with a longing to assume a mantle of
gorgeous ostentation, to powder your hair, and
wrap rich brocades around you, to dance stately
minuets, to discuss my Lady Castlemaine and
that pretty, witty jade, Nell Gwynne, behind
your fan, to traverse London in a <i>chaise à
porteur</i>, to listen to the King&#8217;s &#8220;four-and-twenty
fiddlers&#8221; at Whitehall: in short,&mdash;to
comport yourself as a loyal subject of Charles II.</p>

<p>But before we allow ourselves to lapse into
such delights, we have here two interesting
photographs of an Andrea Amati masterpiece;
a violoncello which numbered among the famous
set of thirty-eight bow instruments sent to
Charles IX., King of France, by Pope Pius V.
We shall linger over these pictures with more
than ordinary interest, for the reason that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
introduce us to the first wavering incursions of
the violoncello against the viola da gamba.
This Amati violoncello was but the advance
guard of the main body which followed at a
later date. Very slowly, but yet surely, the
violoncello ousted the gamba, but its victory
was not a matter of delight to everyone. Many
were the comments upon the matter, and M.
Hubert le Blanc even wrote a clever little book
upon the subject entitled, &#8220;Defense de la Basse
de Viole contre les Enterprises du Violon et les
Pretensions du Violoncel.&#8221; This was brought
out in Amsterdam in 1740, and it is said that the
author was so delighted to find a publisher, after
having tried every firm in Paris, that his enthusiasm
led him to rush off to Amsterdam and
settle there, when he found a publisher in that
town.</p>

<p>Will you come here to the central hall? We
can sit down close to this beautiful majolica and
endeavour to place Duiffoproucart and Amati in
the world of music which surrounded them.
Come!</p>

<div class="hangingindent">
<p>The Renaissance&mdash;The Influence of the Netherlands School&mdash;A
brief Outline of the growing Use of the Viol in
Germany, Italy, England, France</p></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> must be allowed that both Gaspard Duiffoproucart
and Andrea Amati were fortunate in
living at a time when Art, Science, and Literature
had taken a new lease of life. The meeting
of sixteenth-century modernity with antique
culture had created a new atmosphere of learning;
in a word, the Renaissance had dawned,
and progress had begun its march over Europe.
<i>Il Divino</i> Raphaël, Leonardo da Vinci, Savonarola,
Galilei, Lassus, were as comets in the horizon
of advancement. Petrucci in Venice had invented
the art of music printing, and deep in
the heart of the Netherlands there had grown
up a technically equipped school of musical composers,
before which the spontaneous art of the
minstrel was compelled to recede. Impelled onward
by Guillaume Dufay, Johan Ockenghem,
Josquin des Prés, and their successors, to Lassus,
the higher culture of the divine art was making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
rapid progress and consummating the final emancipation
of musical instruments. Already, in the
early part of the sixteenth century, signs and
tokens of the event were observable. In 1511
a native of Strasburg&mdash;Sebastian Virdung&mdash;compiled
a species of miniature Grove&#8217;s dictionary
devoted to the musical instruments of his time.
The work was published in his native town, and
was afterwards extensively cribbed by Agricola
and Luscinis. The numerous woodcuts with
which Virdung&#8217;s work is interspersed are of
interest, especially when such guileless incongruities
as a &#8220;Grosse Geigen&#8221;&mdash;without a bridge&mdash;and
a &#8220;Kleine Geigen&#8221; (a rebec) with a
bridge present themselves.</p>

<p>Ten years after Virdung, Hans Judenkünig
was busy penning little pieces for voices and
stringed instruments, a style of composition that
counted numerous imitators at a later date, both
on the Continent and in England. His manuscript&mdash;published
by good Hans Syngriner in
Vienna in 1523&mdash;consists of a number of short
pieces, songs and dances, with the lute and
viol pieces written in tablature. A precious
copy of this work is jealously preserved in the
Royal Library at Vienna. When one realises
that it is easily within human capacity to feast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
upon its secrets, one cannot help wishing that a
&#8220;magic carpet&#8221; could be requisitioned to take
us to the spot where it now lies, at once. Could
this be accomplished, and we were suddenly
confronted with Judenkünig&#8217;s dog-eared elderly
tome, our feeble attempts at description would
collapse like a Gibus hat. There is something
about time-honoured volumes that commands
silence.</p>

<p>There are other points of interest about
Judenkünig&#8217;s work besides that of its being
the earliest attempt to mingle instruments in
a methodical concerted manner. For instance,
the title-page monopolises our attention, for
the name Geygen is among the first to be found
in print. Then again, further on, there is a
woodcut representation of a man standing erect
and playing on a big six-stringed viol, which
he apparently holds vertically before him.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The
instrument does not touch the ground, and,
doubtless, it is attached round the player&#8217;s neck
by a cord or ribbon, although the artist has
not shown anything of that description. Similar
woodcuts of the period intimate that this
manner of playing the bass-viol was not at
all uncommon during the sixteenth century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
The custom was, doubtless, a survival of those
&#8220;<i>musiciens ambulants</i>,&#8221; the minstrels, who could
not be burdened with many accessories, and,
like the Egyptian camel, carried their belongings
on their backs. It was doubtless with their
fiddles slung round their necks that the Chester
minstrels sallied forth in the reign of King John,
and, unarmed, conquered the besieging Welshmen
by making such a noise that their enemy
imagined themselves to be opposed by an overwhelming
force, and flew. Also, at a later date,
it is easy to imagine the genial Anthony Wood
desiring to escape a little from University
pedagogism and stealing out with five chosen
comrades &#8220;in poor habits,&#8221; and how like
country fiddlers they &#8220;scraped for their livings.&#8221;
Roaming the country with their viols on their
backs, Wood states that they went to &#8220;Farringdon
Fair,&#8221; and, to the house of Mr Thomas
Latton, at &#8220;Kingston Bakepaze,&#8221; who gave
them money and sent drink out to them. After
playing dance music at the inn and visiting other
private houses, a most depressing encounter
with some soldiers considerably damped Anthony
Wood&#8217;s spirits. These men of war forced
them to play in an open field without paying
them a penny. &#8220;Most of my companions,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
says he, referring to the incident, &#8220;would
afterwards glory in this, but I was ashamed and
could never endure to hear of it.&#8221; Among the
five gentlemen who assisted in this escapade he
mentions that &#8220;Edmund Gregorie, B.A., and gent.
com. of Mert. Coll., Ox., played the bass-viol.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another call for playing the bass-viol in the
position depicted by Hans Judenkünig came
from that all-powerful patroness of music&mdash;the
Church. To facilitate the use of viols in the
religious processions, the bass-viol was attached
round the neck of the performer. A small
hole was made in the upper part of the back
of the instrument so employed and a peg inserted.
A cord or chain was attached to this
peg, and passed round the player&#8217;s neck; an
arrangement which allowed him to play with
some degree of ease. Bass-viols so employed
gained the title of &#8220;viola da Spala,&#8221; or shoulder
viols, in Italy, from the position in which they
were held. The early violoncellos, which were
of a small size&mdash;not the size destined to live&mdash;were
submitted to a similar chaining and carrying;
of course, thumb movement and the
numerous treasures of the high positions were
unknown, and the player confined his efforts
to the first position.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>Two years after Hans Judenkünig&#8217;s publication,
Martin Agricola, whose real name was Sore
or Shor, published his &#8220;Musica Instrumental
Deudsch,&#8221; a remarkable work, both from the
point of view of literature and musicianship.
He launched into woodcut representations of
all the viols of the day, and they are probably
there found for the first time in complete
Quartets, with the names under each instrument
as follows:&mdash;&#8220;Discantus&#8221; (treble), &#8220;Altus,&#8221;
&#8220;Tenor,&#8221; &#8220;Bassus.&#8221; The tuning of all these
viols at this period was always regulated by
that prescribed for the lute. Gerle and Judenkünig
states this to be composed of fourths,
with a third intervening, while Agricola instructs
the executant to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Draw up your fifth string as high as you may</div>
<div class="verse">That it may not be broken when on it you play.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>This confusing method was even practised in
the following century, for the worthy John
Playford, in his &#8220;Introduction to the Skill of
Music&#8221; (Twelfth Edition, 1694), tells the
would-be player of the bass-viol that: &#8220;When
you begin to Tune, raise your <i>Treble</i> or smallest
String as high as conveniently it will bear without
breaking; then stop only your <i>Second</i> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
<i>Small Mean</i> in F and tune it till it agree in
<i>Unison</i> with your <i>Treble</i> open,&#8221; and so on with
each string. Imagine a modern orchestra tuned
according to this recommendation!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Turning to Italy during the same period, we find
much of interest. There a princely school of
musicians had grown from the seeds scattered
by those Netherlanders who became welcome
guests of the Medici and other great Italian
families. The cultured <i>cliques</i> of dilettanti, who
were to be found in almost every town in Italy,
were speeding the advancement of music and
musical instruments, while other nations were at a
musical standstill. Amateur viol players were far
from few, and some idea of the growing popularity
of the instrument may be gathered from the fact
that the contemporary painters elected to introduce
it into their pictures. Raphäel&#8217;s painting, of
&#8220;Saint Cecilia&#8221;&mdash;now in the Dresden Gallery&mdash;gives
a faithful representation of the form of the
viol of the period, in the instrument which lies
at her feet. It has no strings upon it, and how
the well-drawn bridge stands upright without
support is an anomaly which has its fellow in
a fresco by Melozzo da Forzi, which graces the
walls of the <i>Sacristie</i> of St Peter&#8217;s in Rome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Among the musical angels there represented is
one who plays on a viol. The strings of this
instrument are depicted raised to the accustomed
distance from the table of the viol, but no trace
of a bridge to support them is visible.</p>

<p>Paul Veronese also elected to introduce the
viol into his masterpiece, the &#8220;Marriage in Cana
of Galilee,&#8221; which is in the Louvre in Paris.
The group of viol players in the background
have a special interest when one realises that it
is Titian who is playing the bass-viol, while
behind him may be seen Tintoretto playing the
alto-viol, and Paul Veronese himself the tenor-viol.
The treble-viol&mdash;called Discantus by
Agricola and Discant in England&mdash;is in the hands
of an ecclesiastic. In Titian&#8217;s picture entitled
the &#8220;Music Lesson,&#8221; to be seen in the National
Gallery, he has shown the custom of singing and
playing to the accompaniment of a bass-viol very
clearly, while Guido Reni in his &#8220;Coronation
of the Virgin,&#8221; in the same gallery, demonstrates
another practice of the period in his two angels
playing the lute and viol. Many other similar
examples of viols are to be found in the paintings
and engravings of that time, and in every case
it is observable that (1) viols were entirely subservient
to the voice; (2) that neither artist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
engraver, nor dilettanti paid much attention to
the violins and violoncellos which were being
made by Andrea Amati in Cremona. That the
shape of all viols was doubtless influenced by
the advent of the stranger violin and still more
foreign violoncello, is probable; indeed, one can
observe the coming ascendancy of the new form
in the bass, which Domenichino has placed in the
hands of his matchless &#8220;St Cecile.&#8221; The <i>f f</i>
holes are full of grace, the primitive C form
being entirely cast aside. The whole outline of
the gamba too is very handsome, and its resemblance
to the bass-viol by the old Brescian,
Pelegrino Zanetti, to be seen in the Musée of
the Paris Conservatoire, is so exact that it is easy
to imagine that that instrument, served as
Domenichino&#8217;s model.</p>

<p>In the first half of the sixteenth century, the
tentative efforts made by such men as Galilei,
Cavalieri, and Peri towards the composition of
music of a more dramatic character than that
which surrounded them at that time, resulted in
a higher status for the viola da gamba, and later,
for the violoncello. For the latter it was a
waiting game, but &#8220;<i>tout vient à celui qui sait
attendre</i>.&#8221; One result of the general agitation
among musical circles was the appearance of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
notable book on the art of playing viols by
Silvestro Ganassi del Fontego. This interesting
work, entitled &#8220;Regola Rubertina,&#8221; was published
in Venice in 1542, and was exclusively devoted
to the art of fingering and tuning treble and
bass viols. A most important fact is to be learnt
from the inscription on the title-page, which
states among other particulars that the book is
suitable for those who play the viol <i>without frets</i>&mdash;evidently
the beginning of a surer technique.</p>

<p>Perhaps nowhere in Italy was the dominant
idea of restoring the learning of the ancient
classics more deeply and fittingly rooted than in
the birthplace of the greatest mediæval poet&mdash;Dante.
In beautiful Florence there were <i>coteries</i>
composed of the most prominent men of the day
who found a common cause in their zeal for the
revival of the culture and polish of former ages.
The house of Giovanni Bardi, Count of Verino,
was more especially a meeting-place for the restless
spirits of the day. Among the company
who there assembled frequently was Vincenzio
Galilei&mdash;the father of the astronomer&mdash;Jacopo
Corsi, Ottavino Rinuccini, Strozzi, Jacopo Peri,
and Emilio Cavalieri. To Peri is accorded the
honour of writing the first opera, and to Cavalieri
the first oratorio&mdash;two mighty steps these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
towards the emancipation of musical instruments,
for both these forms of composition gave birth
to the orchestra. Bent upon freeing music from
the severe canonical style to which the Church
confined it, Galilei made an attempt by writing
a species of Cantata&mdash;<i>Il Conte Ugolino</i>&mdash;which
he himself sang sweetly to the accompaniment
of a bass-viol before the Bardi dilettanti.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
After this effort, Emilio Cavalieri, a Roman
gentleman of good family, and another devoted
member of the Bardi <i>coterie</i>, wrote the important
<i>La Rappresentazione di Anima e di Corpo</i>,
wherein he brought about a more equal unison
of voice, poetry, and instruments. This composition
was performed at the Church of Valicella,
in Rome, and the orchestra consisted of a
Harpsichord, a double Guitar, two Flutes, and a
Basso Viola da Gamba (double bass-viol). No
separate parts were given to the performers, so
doubtless they were left to work out their way
through the maze of figures and signs which
graced the Harpsichord part. These two experiments
led to others of a similar kind. Then
Jacopo Peri, another of the Bardi faction, who
moved in the highest circles of Florentine society,
essayed a still higher flight. Instigated to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
effort by Jacopo Corsi&mdash;another Florentine
nobleman, whose house was likewise a centre
for all the musicians of the day&mdash;and Rinuccini
the poet, he attempted a musical drama which
was believed to be identical in style with that of
the ancient Greek tragedies. This work is the
earliest known opera, it was entitled <i>Dafne</i>,
and was performed at the Palazzo Corsi in 1597.
According to Giov. Batt. Doni, &#8220;it charmed the
whole city,&#8221; so that three years later Peri was
commissioned to write an opera to be performed
on the occasion of the marriage of Henry IV.
of France with Maria di Medici. The title of
this second opera was <i>Euridice</i>; it also scored
a great success, and in the preface to the composition,
Peri himself records that Jacopo Corsi
played the graviciembalo (the piano of the period),
while the rest of the orchestra comprised: a
chitarrone (a kind of guitar) which was in the
hands of Grazio Moritalvo; a lyra grand (species
of bass-viol with a large number of strings) played
by Battista del <i>Violino</i> (note the name) and a
luto grosso (large lute) played by Giovanni
Sani. Thirty years later Giovanni Legranzi
introduced the viola da gamba into his orchestra,
and five years after that a similar number of
violas da gamba, together with two contrabassi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
di viola, are included in the orchestral score of
that mighty innovator, Claudio Monteverdie, in
his opera, <i>Orpheus</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Music in England at the end of the fifteenth
century was but another name for noise. The
dignified minstrel of former times was gone, as
was also the significance of his title. True,
there still existed little bands of wandering
musicians who claimed the name, but they were
composed entirely of the most degenerate classes
of society. Indeed, so noted were they for their
evil practices that it was thought necessary to
issue certain regulations to prevent &#8220;idle persons
under colour of minstrelsy going messages or
other feigned business, being received in other
men&#8217;s houses to meate and drinke.&#8221; But neither
protective laws nor Edward IV.&#8217;s charter, which
was granted to keep outsiders from assuming
the livery of the King&#8217;s minstrels, could revive
the romantic exclusiveness which had formerly
been the privilege of their sect.</p>

<p>Thus music and musical instruments having
lost their chief support in the lordly though
uncultured minstrel, other patrons had to be
found. In Henry VII.&#8217;s reign, Dr Burney tells
us of a certain &#8220;Dr Fayrfax of Newark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Cornyshe&#8221; and a few others who set popular
poetry to music, &#8220;which,&#8221; says he, in his dry
way, &#8220;was uncouth but superior to the music.&#8221;
Then again, we hear in the same reign of the
&#8220;Stryng Minstrels at Westminster,&#8221; and of the
&#8220;waits&#8221; who belonged to each town in England
and made &#8220;merrie musick for the kynge&#8221;
when he passed that way. Henry VIII.&mdash;whose
musical abilities were of no mean order&mdash;included
two viols in the State band in the year
1526. The fifteen trumpets and ten sackbuts,
receiving the most pay, with which the viols
had to compete, doubtless allowed them no
chance of being heard, but they were there,
and it was their <i>début</i> in the royal music; <i>dejâ
quelque chose</i>. Henry VIII.&#8217;s son, Edward VI.,
increased the number of viols in his musical
establishment to eight, which was a significant
augmentation, when we find that his father&#8217;s
sackbuts had been reduced to six. About this
time compositions styled &#8220;songes for severall
voyces&#8221; came into vogue, no doubt instigated
by the visit to these shores of the great Netherlands
composer, Orlando Lassus. The first
of these &#8220;severall voyce&#8221; compositions was
published by Winken de Worde in 1530, and
we make mention of them here because it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
these very &#8220;songes&#8221; for &#8220;three, fower, and
five voyces&#8221; that later became &#8220;Apt for voyce
and vialls,&#8221; and were eventually succeeded by
that form of composition called &#8220;Fantesies.&#8221;
In 1540, the Italian gambist, Ferabosco, established
himself in London, and gave lessons in
the art of viol playing, and, as the cult of the
gamba grew in England, ventures in the land
of concerted music were made by musicians of
the period. In the dumb show English play
entitled <i>Gorbodic</i>&mdash;performed in 1561&mdash;the
earliest English tragedy to be acted on the
stage, music was executed by voices and musical
instruments between the acts. The first act
opened with the instructions that: &#8220;Firste
the Musicke of Violenze began to play, durynge
whiche came in uppon the stage sixe wilde
men clothed in leaues.&#8221; Likewise Gascoyne&#8217;s
<i>Jocasta</i>, of about the same date, was preceded
by a dumb show accompanied by viols, cittaras,
bandoras, and other musical instruments. The
year 1558 saw the publication by Anthony
Munday of &#8220;A Banquet of Daintie Conceits,&#8221;
to be sung to the lute, bandora, virginals, or any
other instrument, and in 1593 one of the earliest
and best music printers of the day, William Barley,
brought out an important work entitled &#8220;A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
New Booke of Tablature containing Instructions
to guide and dispose the Hand, to play on
sundry Instruments, as the Lute, Orpharion,
and Bandora.&#8221; Then came, in 1597, the famous
lutanist John Dowland&#8217;s &#8220;First Booke of Songes
or Ayres of foure Parts, with Tablature for the
Lute. So made that all the Parts together,
or either of them, severally may be sung to
the Lute, Orpharion, or Viol da Gambo.&#8221;
The year 1599 gives us the Psalms of David,
&#8220;in Metre to be sung and played on the lute,
orpharyon, citterne, or base violl,&#8221; by Richard
Allison, &#8220;to be solde at his house in the Duke&#8217;s
Place near Alde-gate,&#8221; and dedicated to the
Countess of Warwick. It is interesting to
note that some MS. lute compositions of
Allison&#8217;s are preserved in the British Museum.
In the same year, Thomas Morley, gentleman
of the Chapel Royal and pupil of William Byrd,
&#8220;by whose endeavours,&#8221; says Anthony Wood,
&#8220;he became, not only excellent in music, as
well as in the theoretical as practical part, but
also well seen in the Mathematicks in which
he was excellent,&#8221; published his &#8220;First Booke
of Consorte Lessons, made by divers exquisite
Authers for six Instruments to play together,&#8221;
dated 1596. The &#8220;six instruments&#8221; selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
to &#8220;play together&#8221; consisted of the &#8220;Treble
Lute,&#8221; &#8220;The Pandora&#8221; (a species of bass-lute),
&#8220;The Citterne&#8221; (small guitar), &#8220;The Base
violl,&#8221; &#8220;The Flute,&#8221; and &#8220;The Treble violl.&#8221;
What this mixture sounded like it is difficult
to surmise. No doubt the players sat round a
large circular table with their &#8220;parts&#8221; spread
out before them; no doubt there was a fine
display of lace ruffles and graceful white hands:
no doubt there were many glances exchanged
between the coquettish lady with the &#8220;Treble
Lute&#8221; and the dark man playing &#8220;The Base
violl&#8221;: no doubt the beauties of the &#8220;exquisite
authors&#8221; were perhaps somewhat lost upon
these two, but &#8220;The Pandora,&#8221; &#8220;The Citterne,&#8221;
&#8220;The Flute,&#8221; and the &#8220;Treble violl&#8221; were
more intent upon the music, and strummed
away to their hearts&#8217; content. Side by side
in a ring lay the parts before the performers
then, but to-day, what a strange irony of Fate
it is that has scattered them about in different
museums and libraries.</p>

<p>In the British Museum you will find the
Flute part printed by &#8220;Thomas Snodham for
John Brown&#8221; and &#8220;sold at his shop in Dunstones
Church Yard in Fleet Street 1611.&#8221; The
&#8220;Trebel violl&#8221; part is preserved in the library<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
at Magdalen College, Oxford. &#8220;The Pandora&#8221;
part is at Christ Church, Oxford, and the &#8220;Cittern&#8221;
part is in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. The
&#8220;Base Violl&#8221; part and the &#8220;Treble Lute&#8221; part
have, curiously enough, disappeared completely.
Did the lady of the &#8220;Lute&#8221; jilt the gentleman of
the &#8220;Base violl&#8221; and he in a fit of rage&mdash;consequent
on the event&mdash;destroy the treacherous
parts that were the means of bringing them
together; or, did they elope, live happy ever
after, and leave directions for the parts&mdash;so full
of tender reminiscences&mdash;to be buried with them?</p>

<p>Morley attempted no other composition of the
kind, for the very good reason that he did not
supply a &#8220;public want&#8221; as do so many of our
modern composers and authors. The reissue
of his work in 1611 proved that it was appreciated
at a later date, but at the time of the
first publication the English people had not yet
broken away from the habit of combining voices
with musical instruments. So Morley had to
capitulate, and in 1600 contented himself with
pleasing the popular taste by bringing out &#8220;The
first booke of Little Aires to sing and play to
the Lute with the Base violl.&#8221; People delighted
in singing these little &#8220;Aires&#8221; in those days.
It was a favourite pastime and must have put a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
stop to a great deal of gossiping, scandalous
chit-chat. The &#8220;Base violl,&#8221; like the guitar
in the barber&#8217;s shop, was kept hanging on the
wall, ready to hand, and when an unloquacious
visitor appeared, how delightful it was to reach
down the &#8220;Base violl&#8221; and sing a &#8220;Little Aire&#8221;
to its accompaniment!</p>

<p>John Maynard wrote a similar set of compositions
which were also published by Snodham
in the same year. These he named &#8220;The XII.
Wonders of the World,&#8221; classified under the
following headings:&mdash;&#8220;The Courtier,&#8221; &#8220;The
Deune,&#8221; &#8220;The Souldiour,&#8221; &#8220;The Phisition,&#8221;
&#8220;The Merchant,&#8221; &#8220;The Country Gentleman,&#8221;
&#8220;The Bachelor,&#8221; &#8220;The Marryed Man,&#8221; &#8220;The
Wife,&#8221; &#8220;The Widow,&#8221; &#8220;The Maide.&#8221; Each
of the little songs are provided with an accompaniment
for the lute and bass-viol. The style
of the poetry is quite in the Gilbertian vein, as
may be judged by the following lines purporting
to describe the duties of a medical man:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>This curious and interesting little volume concludes
with some &#8220;lessons&#8221; for the lute and
viola da gamba, in all of which the player of the
bow instrument never quits the first position.
The whole is dedicated to Maynard&#8217;s &#8220;Honoured
Lady and Mistris the Lady Joane Thymne of
Cause Castle in Shropshire,&#8221; to whom he
addresses a ponderous hyperbole on her gracious
qualities beginning with the amiable wish that
&#8220;Nestor&#8217;s years on earth, and Angels&#8217; happiness
in heaven&#8221; might be hers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The musical attainments of &#8220;La Belle France&#8221;
were full of interest during the same period.
At the beginning of the fifteenth century the
figure of the good King Réné of Anjou faces
his kingdom, viol in hand and whistling the refrain
of his latest composition. A kingly creature
with noble gifts of mind and person which opened
to the first inspiration of the Italian Renaissance
and mingled its vigour with the culture of Provence.
The influence of this minstrel Prince in
the domains of Art was powerful at the time,
yet it was soon obliterated by the coarse
tastes of his conqueror, Louis XI. An instance
of this monarch&#8217;s musical vagaries is instanced
by his command that a concert of pigs should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
be provided for him. The master of the Royal
Music, M. l&#8217;Abbé de Baigne, complied with the
demand of his royal master by inventing an
ingenious arrangement which was a mixture of
pork and piano. He procured swine of various
ages and sizes, placed them in a tent and erected
a keyboard, the notes of which were each furnished
with a spike which was to each pig like
the business end of the nail to the man who
inadvertently came into contact with it. When
the good Abbé attacked the notes vigorously,
each pig became acquainted with his own particular
spike and burst forth into long and pronounced
squeaks. Heretofore we have always
looked upon those numerous nursery rhymes in
which animals figure as instrumentalists as due
to the inventive caprice of the writer. Confronted
with Louis XI.&#8217;s practical application of
such idiosyncrasies, the following couplet is but
a representation of real life after all:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Louis XII.&#8217;s visits to Italy encouraged the
further spread of those artistic tastes introduced
by King Réné. He imported the Italian crafts
and architecture into France, and his choir, which
afterwards graced the court of Francis I., had
not its equal in Europe. It was Louis XII.&#8217;s
influence and taste that laid the foundation of a
new era in French musical art, a foundation upon
which Francis I. built a solid structure. This
monarch&#8217;s tastes were of great assistance to art,
for he keenly encouraged the importations of
Italy&#8217;s treasures and gave appointments at his
court to the Netherlands musicians. He sanctioned
the establishment of Petrucci&#8217;s system of
music printing by Robert Ballard&mdash;who for many
years rejoiced in the privilege of being &#8220;seul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
imprimeur de la musique de la chambre, chapelle,
et menu plaisirs du roi.&#8221; The King was himself
a lute and guitar player of no mean order, and
he could sing his own &#8220;chansons&#8221; to the accompaniment
of these instruments, excellently. It
was this monarch who founded the royal
&#8220;musique de chambre&#8221; by establishing a separate
band which should perform in his anteroom
and on particular occasions. The services of
these musicians were quite independent of those
of the members of the &#8220;chapelle&#8221; band, and
included some of the best artists of the day,
among them Claude Gervaise and the famous
lutanist Albert were especially noted. Gervaise
held a similar post in Henry II.&#8217;s regime and
figured also in Charles IX.&#8217;s musical establishment.
In 1556 he published seven books of
&#8220;Gaillards, Pavan&#8217;s,&#8221; and popular songs for four
and five viols. The appearance of these compositions
in France nearly half-a-century before
Morley&#8217;s &#8220;Consort Lessons for six different Instruments,&#8221;
in England, is in the nature of an anomaly,
seeing that both Maugars and Rousseau state
that in their day (seventeenth century) the viol
was in its youth in France, whereas the English,&mdash;who
had received that instrument straight from
Italy&mdash;were the finest performers in the world.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>Both Henry II., and his son, Charles IX., were
loyal to the traditions of the musical tastes of
their family. The first of these monarchs we
know granted Duiffoproucart his &#8220;lettres de
naturalisation,&#8221; and it is quite within the bounds
of possibility that his gamba, now before us, and
the Amati violoncello, which we are about to
discuss, came in contact with one another at the
French court. The Machiavelian-like man&oelig;uvres
of Marie de Medici at her son&#8217;s court did not
squash Charles IX.&#8217;s ardent love of music and
poetry, any more than Henry VIII.&#8217;s matrimonial
imbroglios prevented him from attaining a degree
of excellence on the flute. It is said that the
French king frequently took part with the
choir of his &#8220;Chapelle&#8221; in singing Mass in the
manner of his father, and that he was greatly
attached to his musicians. In spite of his
affection for them, however, he advocated low
living and high thinking for them. &#8220;Poets and
musicians resemble horses,&#8221; said he, &#8220;they
become soft and lose their vivacity if surrounded
by abundance, let them be nourished
but not fattened.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was during this monarch&#8217;s reign that the
important event of the foundation of an
&#8220;Academie de Musique&#8221; by a distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
poet and musician&mdash;Antoine de Bäif<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>&mdash;took
place. The premises of this establishment were
situated in the poet&#8217;s own home in the Faubourg
Saint Marcel. All the most eminent musicians
of the day, both native and foreign, were
received and handsomely entertained at this
&#8220;Academie,&#8221; and each week a grand concert of
vocal and instrumental music was given and regularly
attended by Charles IX. Marguerite de
Valois, the King&#8217;s sister, in imitation of De Bäif,
also established an &#8220;Academie de Musique&#8221;
at her Palace of Issy and herself presided at
the concerts, which were held in the grounds
of the <i>chateau</i>. At the base of a limpid fountain
the Princess and her musicians assembled
each week, and the poets of the day named the
fountain &#8220;Castalinus&#8221; in memory of that which
flowed at the feet of Parnassus, consecrated by
the ancient Greeks to the Muses.</p>

<p>It is under the date 27th October 1572&mdash;but
three days after the tragic St Bartholomew&#8217;s Eve&mdash;that
the &#8220;Archives Curieuses de l&#8217;Histoire de
France&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> records a certain flautist, named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Nicolas Delinet, receiving money wherewith to
buy a &#8220;Cremona Violin&#8221;:&mdash;&#8220;A Nicolas Delinet
joeur de Fluste et Violon dudict la somme de 50
livres tourn pour lui donner moyen d&#8217;achepter

Sieur,&#8221; so runs the announcement. From this
<i>purchase</i> of a Cremona violin, it may be inferred
that the exquisite Amati &#8220;set&#8221; to which this
violoncello belonged had not yet arrived from
Italy. Yet they were sent in the year 1572.
The thought presents itself irresistibly that
Pope Pius V. sent this handsome present to
Charles IX. as a token of his approbation of the
St Bartholomew Massacre. The completeness
of the &#8220;set&#8221;: the novelty of shaping the bass
instruments in the same form as the violin, and
the appropriateness of such a gift to the music-loving
Charles, all point to an intimate personal
graciousness, which might well be taken for a
secret approval of some deed or event.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> romances of real life are generally allowed
to be far more amazing than anything fiction
can create. Perhaps though, when all is said
and done, the most sentimental or interesting
happenings are not those which lie concealed in
reality or myth, but in the unwritten something
which clings about the antique treasures we
prize&mdash;&#8220;Those certain things&#8221; which Oliver
Wendell Holmes calls &#8220;good for nothing unless
they have been kept for a long while.&#8221;</p>

<p>That old oak chair is more precious than a
modern production, not because the wood is
better or the make more solid, but for the misty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
reminiscences of lace and buskin, Cavalier and

which it once graced.</p>

<p>This china vase: this tapestry: this antique
ring&mdash;we have but to look at them and they
tell us many an unwritten story, impossible to
repeat, and appealing to us alone. Of all the
mute romancers carefully preserved from time&#8217;s
destructive grasp, none can tell such tales as do
the grand old fiddles. Those constant yielding
companions of generations passed away have
served as confessional boxes for so many
centuries that each curve and bend teems with a
secret. Take this masterpiece of Andrea Amati
for instance (p. 114). Made in Cremona by a
man of the mature age of fifty-two or thereabouts,
the impulsive hazard of his youthful
efforts had long since passed away: definite aim
had developed his gifts, and ripe experience had
given his hand an exquisite cunning. Little did
he think as he sat in his sunny Cremona workshop,
smoothing the back of this violoncello,
bending the ribs, letting in the purfled edges,
while he chatted now and again with a neighbour
who dropped in, that he was building a
monument to his own memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>Sent with its fellows to the French court, this
violoncello arrived, with the painted armorial
bearings of Charles IX., exquisitely pure and
fresh in colour, upon its back and sides. It was
relegated to the King&#8217;s &#8220;Chapelle,&#8221; or private
oratory, doubtless occupying a humble position
in the band where the Duiffoproucart viol was
prominent: feeling the touch of fresh fingers,
as the old ones lost their skill: seeing the
intrigues of the court life: hearing the cries of,
&#8220;The King is dead! Long live the King!&#8221;
observing each phase of human love and folly,
and watching the vagaries of Princes for over
two hundred years. Truly your tales would
outrival Balzac himself could you speak, and
your royal title&mdash;&#8220;the King&#8221;&mdash;is but a well-deserved
panegyric.</p>

<p>At the time of the French Revolution, in
1790, this violoncello is said to have been still
in use at the court of the unfortunate Louis XVI.
On the 6th and 7th of October in that year the
mob destroyed the whole magnificent &#8220;set&#8221;&mdash;consisting
of twenty-four violins (twelve large,
and twelve small), six tenors, and eight basses&mdash;to
which it belonged. Two of the violins of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
this number were afterwards recovered by
Viotti&#8217;s pupil, M. J. B. Cartier, and one of the
small violins belonged to George Somes, Esq., in
1884. These fiddles, and this violoncello&mdash;&#8220;The
King&#8221;&mdash;are apparently the only members
of the &#8220;set&#8221; that survived the reckless
vengeance of the mob. When one realises how
easily such delicate constructions are ruined in
sacrilegious hands, their preservation in the
midst of the pandemonium, which reigned
supreme at that time in Paris, is miraculous.</p>

<p>After the Revolution a glimpse of the whereabouts
of &#8220;The King&#8221; is afforded us by a
pencilled note written by the father of its
present owner on the back of the frame, containing
the interesting slip of paper which has
accompanied this violoncello for at least a
hundred years. On the paper itself the
following inscription is written in French
characters:&mdash;&#8220;Basse faitte par erndre ermati
Luthiér â cremonne eu italie en 1572. envoyez
par le pape 3: à Charles 9 roi de france pour
sa chapelle.&mdash;avec ses amories et se devise,
pietate justicia.&#8221; Turning this little framed
document over, the three faintly pencilled
words, &#8220;Duport had it,&#8221; seem to imply that
&#8220;The King,&#8221; during the Napoleonic era, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the property of Berteau&#8217;s gifted pupil, Jean
Pierre Duport, known generally as &#8220;Duport
l&#8217;ainé.&#8221; If this was the case, then this violoncello
went with him to the court of Frederick
the Great at Berlin. It is more probable, however,
that it fell into the hands of Jean Pierre&#8217;s
brother, Jean Louis Duport&mdash;one of the finest
violoncellists of his day&mdash;as he became a
member of Napoleon&#8217;s band and professor at the
Conservatoire of Music. Another pencilled
note in the same hand, at the back of the frame,
stating that &#8220;A Hollander brought it to Betts in
1812, and he sold it to H. W. Curtis&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> (afterwards
Sir William Curtis) still further points to
Duport, the younger, as its owner, for Duport
was in sore straits at one time. This accomplished
artist, it may be remembered, also held
an appointment at the court of Frederick the
Great, but when the defeats of Auerstädt and
Jena placed Prussia in the position of a suppliant
at the feet of Napoleon, Duport returned to
Paris utterly ruined. If the violoncello had
belonged to his brother it is possible that Jean
Pierre may have ceded it to the more accomplished
Jean Louis, and the latter brought it to Paris in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
1806, where his misfortunes induced him to part
with it to a dealer. The next we hear of &#8220;The
King&#8221; is on the death of Sir William Curtis,
when it figures in the catalogue of his musical
instruments&mdash;which were sold by auction on
3rd May 1829&mdash;as: &#8220;Lot 9, a violoncello by
Andrea Amati Cremonencis Faciebat, 1572. A
document was given to the proprietor when he
purchased this instrument, stating that it was
presented by Pope Pius V. to Charles IX., King
of France, for his chapel. It has been richly
decorated, the arms of France being on the
back and the motto &#8216;Pietate et Justitia&#8217; on the
sides. The tone of this violoncello is of extraordinary
power and richness.&#8221; The Rev. Canon
A. H. Bridges, Rector of Beddington, either
bought it at the above sale, or from Sir William
Curtis&#8217;s survivors. On the death of Canon
Bridges, in 1891, it became the property of his
son, the present owner, John Henry Bridges,
Esq., of Ewell Court, Surrey.</p>

<p>Some connoisseurs describe &#8220;The King&#8221; to
be nothing but a curiosity at the present time.
This is hardly correct, for, in spite of its having
been very much knocked about in the past, it
still retains a sweet quality of tone which makes
it a delightful drawing-room instrument. Like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Amati&#8217;s fiddles &#8220;The King&#8221; is of small dimensions;
indeed violoncellos at this early date were
nothing but extra large tenors, and it was not
until makers turned their attention to evolving
violoncellos out of the viola da gamba that the
former began to take a prominent place in the
ranks of stringed instruments. The transition
itself from gamba to the early form of violoncello
took place in the second half of the sixteenth
century but&mdash;&#8220;Who effected the change?&#8221;
Was it Duiffoproucart in Lyons, Andrea Amati
in Cremona, or Gasparo da Salo, looking forth
over the sunny plains of Lombardy? The
correct reply is perhaps&mdash;&#8220;All!&#8221; Duiffoproucart
reduced the size of the huge German
geiges so as to furnish what Rousseau in his
&#8220;Dictionnaire de Musique&#8221; defines as &#8220;<i>les
instruments de remplissage</i>.&#8221; Previous to the
dispersion of viols into various sizes, they were
universally large both in Italy and later in
France and England. &#8220;The first viols in use
in France,&#8221; says Jean Rousseau&mdash;the eminent
violist&mdash;in his &#8220;Traité de la Viole&#8221; (Paris,
1687), &#8220;had five strings, and were very large
... of such dimensions indeed, that the Père
Mersenne says that a young <i>Page de Musique</i>
could be shut within to sing the treble part,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
while the bass was played upon the self-same
instrument&#8221;&mdash;an arrangement which certainly
could not contribute to the happiness of either
the little page, or the bass-viol, and the diminishing
process which necessarily did away
with such a forlorn practice was certainly
welcome to all the actors in the trio. Owing
to the breaking up of the viols into various
sizes, orchestras grew in proportion, so that
we find in the <i>Etat de France</i> for 1645, that
the &#8220;Musique de la Chambre de Monsieur&#8221;
(Louis XIV.&#8217;s brother) boasted &#8220;Nicolas
Fleury&#8221; and &#8220;Pierre Montigny&#8221; as players
of the Haute Contre,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> &#8220;Pierre Noinne&#8221; and
&#8220;N... le Vert&#8221; as players of the Taille
Basses,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> while &#8220;Francois Martin&#8221; and &#8220;Guillaume
Mercer&#8221; disported themselves on the
&#8220;Taille Haute.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> In the beginning of the
following century, further names of <i>instruments
de remplissage</i>, appear in the Paris Opera
orchestra: for instance &#8220;2 quintes&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> &#8220;2
tailles,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and &#8220;3 haute contres.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the result of Duiffoproucart&#8217;s creation
of the small viola da gamba, a size which broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
into many degrees and kinds. Then Andrea
Amati made a further step in the right direction
by making small-sized bass instruments in the
same form as the violin, which had at that time
assumed the shape now so familiar. The moot
question&mdash;&#8220;Was it Andrea Amati in Cremona,
or Gasparo da Salo in Brescia who first made
violoncellos in the form of the violin?&#8221;&mdash;is of
course unanswerable at this space of time. Da
Salo was a man of progress, ready to fight for
his opinions. He made some fine double-basses
and grand tenors which are sought after to this
day, and Herr August Reichers, the Berlin
violin-maker, possessed a small-sized violoncello
by this maker in 1884. If this instrument was
not a cut-down bass-viol, or an exceptionally
large tenor, it is apparently a solitary example
of a violoncello by Da Salo, but even though its
existence be allowed, the numerous violoncellos
made by Andrea Amati must necessarily admit
him to be&mdash;if not the inventor&mdash;at least the
earliest known <i>luthier</i> to make violoncellos.</p>

<p>Although Da Salo may be looked upon as no
enthusiast where violoncellos were concerned,
he was not neglectful in the matter of other
bass instruments. Signor Dragonetti possessed
no fewer than three fine basses by the Brescian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
maker, of various sizes, and Mr Hart, in 1875,
owned a small double-bass of Da Salo&#8217;s which
had been brought from Italy by Tarisio, and
was looked upon as the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of its kind.
A Da Salo viola da gamba, catalogued as of the
year 1570, was to be seen among the sumptuous
display of musical instruments shown at the
Special Loan Exhibition held at Fishmongers&#8217;
Hall in the summer of 1904.</p>

<p>But, fortunately, we need not rely entirely
upon catalogues, description, and speculation for
an idea of Da Salo&#8217;s skill as a gamba-maker, for,
here beside us, in their neat glass house, two
examples of the fine old Brescian repose in calm
tranquillity, like veterans silently ruminating over
many campaigns. They both face us with the
quaint C-shaped sound-holes, so dear to the
hearts of the old viol-makers, and both display
upper tables of remarkably well-chosen even-grained
pine wood. One of them is strung
with seven strings, but the seventh is a later
invention, for the earliest viols had five strings,
then six, and it was not until the last part of
the seventeenth century that Sainte Colombe
(some say Marais) added another to the six.
A true unaltered seven-stringed viol is hardly
ever to be met with now. A solitary and excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
example, however, was lent by M. Galley
to the Special Loan Exhibition at South Kensington
in 1872. This was a remarkably handsome
gamba and had remained untouched, with
the exception of an attempt to attach sympathetic
strings. A further adjunct to be found
in this Da Salo gamba before us is the scroll,
which curves round in a unique manner like a
wisp of twisted ribbon: this never felt the
touch of Da Salo&#8217;s hand. It may be the work
of Barak Norman, for a similar, indeed identical,
scroll crowns his gamba now in the Donaldson
Museum, but certainly it is not Da Salo&#8217;s work.
In his day sculptured human and animal heads
were <i>de rigueur</i>, and, like his contemporaries, he
carved these himself, or employed special artists
to do so. In Germany the followers of Jacobus
Stainer of Absam&mdash;whose favourite ornament
was a lion&#8217;s head&mdash;freely adopted this practice,
but the custom died out first in Italy, where
viol-makers discovered that such a system was
far from remunerative.</p>

<p>Close to this gamba of Da Salo&#8217;s with the
spurious scroll, his second example exhibits his
skill as a wood-carver, in the exquisitely chiselled
head of an old woman, which surmounts the
neck. The varnish is slightly darker on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
gamba than on the one beside it. Age is no
doubt responsible for this and not the maker
himself, as it is also for the black Da Salo fiddles
of which some connoisseurs speak with a degree
of scorn. It may be noticed that there is but
one line of purfling round this gamba. This
was such an ordinary custom with Da Salo that
comment is unnecessary. It is clumsily let in,
lacking the grace and finish expended upon this
difficult art by Cremona makers. The Amatis
above all others excelled in the neatness of their
purfling, and the customary three lines is always
to be met with in their fiddles as well as in those
of Stradivarius. The latter, however, on one
solitary occasion reverted to one line of purfling
in the violoncello upon which Bernard Romberg
played for many years. This instrument is
unique in many ways, for the gifted Cremonese
maker made the back and sides of plane wood
and poplar, material which he employed occasionally
in the early part of his career, but
which he had discarded at the date (1711) he
made the violoncello.</p>

<p>Speaking of wood, by-the-by, the proper selection
of timber was held to be a matter of great
importance by the ancient <i>luthier</i>. M. Fetis, in
his &#8220;Antonio Stradivarius,&#8221; has given some interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
information regarding the source from
whence the old viol-makers obtained their wood.
He says that maple was sent from Croatea,
Turkey and Dalmatia to Venice in the shape of
galley oars, and that the Turks, ever seeking to
outrival the Venetians, and consequently frequently
at war with them, took care to choose
wood with the handsomest wave, knowing well
that it would break the more easily. It was from
among this selection that the viol-maker had to
gather his timber. In his own country there was
certainly little difficulty in obtaining wood, but,
where would he get such maple as came to him
from Dalmatia? Secretly he welcomed this</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;... thing devised by the enemy&#8221;</p>

<p>and turned it to good account. The illustrious
Da Salo was very partial to pear wood as well
as sycamore, which he cut slab-ways from the
tree, as did most of his contemporaries.
Stradivarius preferred maple to any other wood,
but he went with the times and also employed
the woods favoured by his brethren, such as
poplar, lime, and even grained pine. A species
of red pine, common to the Tyrol, and known
to the Italian makers by the name of &#8220;Azarole,&#8221;
was more in favour with the Cremona <i>luthier</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
than Swiss pine. Only the south side, the
side exposed to the drying rays of the sun,
was used. Indeed, this precaution is one which
has been observed by makers for over three
hundred years, knowing well that it is one of
the first aids towards solving the problem:
<i>Given</i>: A log of wood. <i>Make</i>: A fiddle. The
timber must be blameless, free from knots or
blemish, and&mdash;above all&mdash;free from worm, a
fate which has destroyed whole forests of pine
if the trees are cut at the wrong season of the
year. Also the tree must have arrived at a
maturity of ten years, and the question of sap
flowing through the outer part of the tree must
be duly considered. Speaking on this subject,
Mr Davidson<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> remarks that, owing to the sap
passing through this part of the tree, the wood
abounds in saccharine matter and is quickly susceptible
to decay. In trees which have arrived
at maturity, there is no distinction between the
sap and heart wood, the wood being of the
same texture throughout and almost uniform.
The proper time for cutting trees is when the
sap ceases to flow, and experience has determined
the month of December to be the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
time for this purpose, as the wood which has
been cut during this month has been found to
have always been of superior quality to any cut
during the other months. Monsieur l&#8217;Abbé
Sibre, author of &#8220;La Chelonome ou le parfait
Luthérie,&#8221; which was published at the beginning
of the nineteenth century, voices the merits of
wood cut in December and January long before
Mr Davidson, and adds the admonition that the
wood must be cut from between the bark and
heart of the tree. The wood being cut as required
from the healthy pine or maple, it is
sawn into planks, and,&mdash;though the fiddle-maker&#8217;s
hands are madly twitching to commence operations
on it,&mdash;subjected to a drying process to be
effected by sun and air for at least six years.
If at the end of that period of time the <i>luthier</i>
is still enamoured of his timber, then he may
clamp it and cut it and scrape it into the violin
or violoncello of his fancy. Monsieur Simoutre,
the French violin-maker and author of some
patent improvements which, in common with
all innovations connected with bow instruments,
have had no lasting effect, contends that the
best pine wood comes from Silesia, from La
Valteline, Les Grisons, Le Simmenthal in the
Bernese Alps, from certain sheltered parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the valley of the Lac de Joux, in the Canton
de Vaud, Switzerland, and from the southern
slopes of the Jura Bernois. Modern violin-makers
generally employ maple cut from trees
growing on the southern slopes of the Carpathians
and also in some parts of the Eastern
Alps, but where this is not procurable, it has
been found that it is not absolutely necessary
to range the Alps or the Carpathians in search
of suitable wood, for many a fine violin and
violoncello have been made from the wainscot
or beam of an old-time cottage or mansion.
J. B. Vuillaume used to roam over Italy and
Switzerland frequently for the sole purpose of
picking up choice bits of pine which had probably
formed part of a beam or support in some
residence for hundreds of years. Out of these
purchases he undoubtedly made some of his
finest instruments. His example has recommended
itself to many other makers, and only
the other day we heard of a contemporary
English maker whose best violins and violoncellos
have been formed from an old beam
obtained from a house near Eltham. Such
practices as these certainly place <i>lutherie</i> within
the range of everyone so inclined, for, who is
there in these days that does not possess a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
likely piece of old furniture? some familiar
escritoire, or table, or panel, out of which a
possible rival to Cremona&#8217;s <i>chefs-d&#8217;&oelig;uvre</i> may
be conjured by the aid of gouge, chisel, bending
iron, and glue pot. In spite of the time-saving
effects which the appropriation of the
family heirlooms for this purpose would effect,
how much more appealing and poetic were
the methods of the ancient <i>luthier</i>, who went
straight to the forest for his wood. Can one
picture Stradivarius storing up old beams, and
tables, on the roof of his house in Cremona?
Can we imagine Guarnerius roaming about
the country seeking likely bits of wood in
cottages, or the Amatis, or Da Salo, the maker
of these gambas, resorting to such a commonplace
expedient. No! a thousand times. They
went straight to the forest for their timber,
wandered through the misty depths of clustered
pines, pondering in the deep silence upon many
a knotty point of their craft. Or they stood
at times on the rocky borders of the wood,
where the trees looked down upon the valley
from whence the sound of the rushing brook
could be faintly heard. From a point of vantage
they watched the trees being felled:
hearkened to the tone they emitted as their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
torn limbs bounded from rock to rock: counted
the number of circles to ascertain the age of
a likely tree: examined the colour with care
to judge of its health. If they were satisfied
with these various preliminary tests, they bought
what they required, stored the planks on the
sheltered side of their workshop or on the roof
of the same, and watched the hot Italian sun
do its work of drying. Not only did the most
eminent makers of the past carefully store their
own wood, but if they became possessed of a
particularly handsome piece they did not scruple
to patch and piece it together, so that no scrap
of the treasure should be wasted.</p>

<p>Gasparo da Salo, as we have already said, was
an adept in the choice of wood, and he was
fortunate in lighting upon some particularly even-grained
pine. In these days his work is looked
upon as rough, or, to put it more gently, primitive.
The recent researches of Il Cavalieri Livi&mdash;the
keeper of the Brescian state archives&mdash;have,
however, proved that this was far from
the case in his lifetime. Until the results of
the Cavalieri&#8217;s investigations were published
in the <i>Nuova Antalogia</i> on the 16th August
1891, nothing definite concerning this maker&#8217;s
life was known. Thanks to the Brescian income-tax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
returns and other authentic documentary
evidence it is now proved that Da Salo&#8217;s real
name was not Salo at all but Gasparo di Bertolotti,
that he rejoiced in a grandfather named
Santino di Bertolotti who was a lute-maker at
Polpenazze, that his father was one Francesco
Bertolotti, a painter familiarly called &#8220;Violino&#8221;
by his friends, and that his son, Gasparo, the
future violin-maker, was born at Salo, a small
town on Lake Garda, not many miles distant
from Brescia. Unfortunately the date of Da
Salo&#8217;s birth still remains unknown, owing to the
loss of the pages from the parish register where
it should appear, but the income-tax returns
for 1568 state him to be twenty-six years of
age at that date, and those for 1588, forty-five,
thus locating his birth approximately in the year
1542. It is presumed that he learnt his art
from his grandfather first, and later from a
Brescian viol-maker of the name of Gerolamo
Virchi, who stood sponsor to Gasparo&#8217;s son,
Francesco. The earliest efforts of the great
Brescian master apparently did not find favour
with his fellow-countrymen, and, this being so,
he became discouraged and contemplated trying
his fortunes in France. A certain Father Gabriel
saw the gifted man&#8217;s dispirited efforts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
also observed his intentions. He was reluctant
to see one of his flock go forth to a foreign
country, and to prevent such a calamity came
forward with a loan of £60. Curiously enough
this small sum changed the bent of Da Salo&#8217;s
life. He remained, and encouraged by the
faith of the good priest set to work with such
definite aim and earnestness, that as a result he
soon established himself in a house with a shop
in the <i>Contrada del Palazzo vecchio</i>. This event
occurred in the year 1568. He paid £20 rent
per annum for this establishment, valued his
stock of musical instruments at about £60, and
styled himself <i>Magistro di Violini</i>. In 1579 he
exhibited the added title of <i>Magistro di Cittaris</i>,
and in 1583 called himself <i>Artefice d&#8217;instrumenti
musica</i>. Twenty years after his first establishment
in the <i>Contrada del Palazzo vecchio</i>, he
changed his residence to the <i>Contrada Cocere</i>,
where he claimed to be the owner of violins
finished and unfinished valuing quite £200, and
where he had acquired the ostentatious title of
<i>Magister instrumentorum musicorum</i>. The year
1599 found him purchasing another house in
Brescia, situated in the <i>Contrada di St Pietro di
Martero</i>, and between 1581 and 1607 he owned
land adjoining Calvagese, near Salo. It was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Calvagese that Da Salo&#8217;s son, Francesco, found
his bride, the Signora Fior. He also followed
the captivating profession of his father, until
the latter&#8217;s death on the 14th April 1609, when
he apparently lost heart, for from that time he
ceased to be a <i>luthier</i>. Probably he sold the
excellent business to Da Salo&#8217;s gifted pupil, Gio.
Paolo Maggini, who had worked as an apprentice
in the Brescian master&#8217;s workshop for quite eight
years, and was then a bachelor of thirty or thereabouts.
In any case, whether he became possessed
of the business or not, the esteem which
had previously been bestowed upon his instructor
fell to his share. On the whole he deserved all
the support he gained for he not only equalled Da
Salo as a maker but surpassed him in everything
save the ugly stiff sound holes which, for some
unaccountable reason, he retained.</p>

<p>In the history of the violoncello, it is a
puzzling and curious circumstance, that no viola
da gamba by Maggini is extant.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> His violins,
violas, violoncellos and double-basses have resisted
the onslaught of over three hundred
adventurous years, and, this being so, one cannot
help wondering why his gambas have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
also withstood time&#8217;s ravages. The obvious
reply seems to be that, &#8220;He made none!&#8221;
However, whether he did or did not, his
attitude certainly had no effect on the position
occupied by the violoncello at that time. The
general feeling about the instrument was akin
to the sentiments expressed by the Comte de
Rabutin in his &#8220;Epistles&#8221;:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Je ne vous aime pas, Hylas;</div>
<div class="verse">Je n&#8217;en saurois dire la cause,</div>
<div class="verse">Je sais seulement un chose;</div>
<div class="verse">C&#8217;est que je ne vous aime pas.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Not being liked, and yet appearing among
them, musicians were confronted with a
difficulty which they solved by placing this
&#8220;white elephant&#8221; in the obscure position of
playing the fundamental bass in the music of
the Church.</p>

<p>As regards the lack of Maggini violas da
gamba, circumstantial evidence may be right
after all. The man was a genius, and, true to
his instincts, sought after new methods rather
than personal gain. He threw aside the useless
and picked out the good, and, this being so, it
is not surprising that he should prefer to turn
his attention to the budding violoncello, rather
than the pristine viola da gamba.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>In the delightful monograph of this maker&#8217;s
life&mdash;already mentioned&mdash;among the excellent
summary of the instruments made by him, there
is an interesting description of a quartet of
instruments generally known as the &#8220;Dumas
Set,&#8221; from its having once belonged to a family
of that name. In an ancient château near
Lyons the members of the Dumas household
passed through the terrors of the first Revolution
and saw the establishment of the Empire.
They were enthusiastic musical amateurs&mdash;friends
of Beethoven&mdash;and inspired by a
genuine love of chamber music they collected
together four magnificent examples of Maggini&#8217;s
skill. Of the four instruments&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> violin, viola,
violoncello and double-bass&mdash;which comprise the
&#8220;set,&#8221; the violin and viola are of the most
characteristic and perfect type, although the
violoncello is also excellent. According to
Lady Huggins&#8217;s description of the last, &#8220;it has
two lines of purfling, but no ornamental device.
The bottom circle of the sound-holes is smaller
than the top. There is the same under-bevelling
of the inside edge of the sound-holes, as in
Maggini&#8217;s other instruments, the same arching
of the model. The wood of the back and the
sides is cut on the slab&#8221; (parallel with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
growth of the tree&mdash;a favourite practice with
the ancient viol-makers). &#8220;The back is joined,
also the belly, the latter having the wood the
ordinary way of the grain, the coarse grain
being outside.&#8221; As we look at the instrument,
the thought involuntarily rises in us&mdash;&#8220;to
Maggini we owe our modern violoncello.&#8221;
What a curious mixture of the &#8220;old&#8221; and the
&#8220;new&#8221; is to be found in this instrument. The
back cut on the &#8220;slab&#8221;&mdash;in accordance with
the long-standing custom&mdash;and the belly cut in
the improved manner. Maggini, although a
great innovator, and the first to cut the wood
in the new way&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> wedge-ways from the tree&mdash;was
evidently in a state of uncertainty when
he made this violoncello. To balance matters
he mingled the divers ways, yet, in spite of his
hesitation, he came nearer to gauging the most
equitable proportions for the violoncello than
any other maker of his time. It would be of
great interest if it were possible to discover
by what means Maggini and his predecessors
arrived at their conclusions. Whether it was
in the manner of old Mrs Tibbins, who made a
fiddle by means of a blunt knife, a piece of
glass, and a bent file, or, on the principles of
Monsieur Felix Savart. If the ancient <i>luthier</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
planned his work on the latter&#8217;s scientific basis,
then he was accurate in every detail, for no
more satisfactory experiments on the construction
of bow instruments have been attempted.
The idea of these experiments was suggested
by a guitar-shaped violin made by Stradivarius
and owned by the elder Chanot. Imagining
that so eminent a maker would not have constructed
such a violin without good reason,
Monsieur Savart&mdash;a doctor of medicine&mdash;threw
up his profession for that of science and
interested himself in organising a series of
tests in the first half of the nineteenth century.
As a result of his labours <i>luthiers</i> were at last
confronted with the astounding assertion that
an arched surface vibrates less readily than a
plane one: that there are points where the
vibrations are greatly reduced, and that the
aggregate vibration is least at the sound holes
and at the corner blocks of a violin or violoncello.</p>

<p>Starting from this groundwork, M. Savart
constructed a violin entirely made of flat surfaces
and straight lines with narrow rectilinear slits
for sound holes (so as to cut as few of the
fibres of the wood as possible) and no tailpiece,
the drag of the latter on the tender part of
the belly being considered detrimental to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
instrument. The most astonishing part of this
fiddle was that it passed the test of comparison
with a Stradivarius victoriously. The members
of the Académie des Sciences formed a council
and, assisted by such eminent musicians as
M. Berton, Catel le Sueure, and Cherubini,
sat in solemn judgment. The merits of the
instrument were considered by them at several
meetings, and the gifted violinist, M. Lefebvre,
was requested to play alternately upon a <i>chef-d&#8217;&oelig;uvre</i>
of Cremona and the Savart &#8220;box-fiddle,&#8221;
in an adjoining room. The decision arrived at
by these gentlemen was that the square fiddle
was every bit as good in tone&mdash;if not better&mdash;as
the Cremona violin. Of course this was
most flattering to the inventor, yet it is a
question whether such excellent results would
have taken place had the Savart fiddle been
in less skilful hands. The great violinist Remenyi
maintained that he could produce just as
good a tone out of an eight-shilling fiddle as
out of a 1000-guinea one. Monsieur Lefebvre&#8217;s
handling of the &#8220;box-fiddle&#8221; was doubtless
superior to the fiddle itself and,&mdash;as Voltaire said
of Duport&#8217;s violoncello playing,&mdash;he made the
council of impulsive Frenchmen believe in miracles
&#8220;by making a nightingale out of an ox.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>A few years previous to Monsieur Savart&#8217;s
researches M. Chanot&mdash;a naval officer, and a
member of the distinguished family of violin-makers
of that name, being compelled to leave
the navy on account of his staunch Royalist
predilections&mdash;had turned his attention to constructing
guitar-shaped fiddles and violoncellos.
These were also subjected to similar tests by
the members of the Académie des Sciences
and&mdash;as in the case of the Savart fiddle&mdash;pronounced
to be superior to the instruments of
Cremona. There were independent experts,
however, who considered them faulty in tone
and only to be regarded as curiosities. In the
midst of diverse criticisms, these instruments
found a market for a few years, the violins and
violas fetching 300 francs, while 500 francs was
the price demanded for the violoncellos. Those
who desire to pursue the subject of vagaries,
will find much to interest them in Mr Davidson&#8217;s
&#8220;The Violin,&#8221; and Mr Heron Allen&#8217;s &#8220;Violin-making
as it was and is&#8221;; sufficient for present
purposes is it to know that such grotesqueness
as eighteen stringed violins played with a bow
and producing the combined effect of the violin,
viola, violoncello and double-bass: the combination
violin and violoncello with piano which can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
be played by one person: the melephone, which
was nothing more than a concertina enclosed in
a species of violoncello, and other such fallacies,
have been relegated to the land of oblivion.
Certain it is that the ancient viol-maker never
dreamed of such horrors. Once in a way he
attempted such a mild invention as a detachable
neck, which could be unscrewed and placed
inside the instrument through a door in the
ribs, like the viola da gamba in the Donaldson
Museum, but otherwise his methods, like his
varnish, were so simple that he made no fuss
about them. He saw no necessity for rushing
into print, or taking out patents, or wrangling,
or arguing. The traditions of his graceful craft
were transmitted by word of mouth and practical
demonstration to his pupils, and the pupils, living
in an atmosphere of <i>lutherie</i>, sucked in the unwritten
lore as naturally as the earth absorbs
rain. What need to cry out the sky is blue,
when all the world can see it!</p>

<p>It was among such surroundings that the
mighty Stradivarius learnt his art in the workshops
of Nicolo Amati, grandson of Andrea
Amati, who made &#8220;The King.&#8221; The <i>atelier</i> of
this maker was a very nest of talent in the
middle of the seventeenth century, for Nicolo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Amati&#8217;s renown attracted all the most enthusiastic
young aspirants of the art. It is easy to imagine
the grand spirit of emulation, and even rivalry,
which must have existed within the four walls
of Amati&#8217;s premises in Cremona. An unrivalled
master of his art at the time, bestowing
care and thought on every part of his work,
there is no doubt that he did much towards
advancing the construction of the violoncello in
the matter of experimenting with thicknesses, but
he did not alter the dimensions of the violoncello
which was at that time about 31 inches
in length, if not longer. The majority of
Amati violoncellos have been cut down, so that
it is difficult to judge of their original size, but
it is probable that they originally measured over
31 inches in length. The paramount influence
of the Church in musical matters was responsible
for the large dimensions of the violoncello at
that date; it was looked upon as useful to reinforce
the double-bass, or &#8220;bass-violin&#8221; as it
was then called, for the big viols had already
gone out of use in Italy in the middle of the
seventeenth century. In &#8220;The Familiar Letters
of Abraham Hill&#8221; (London 1767), his brother,
Thomas, writing to him from Lucca, 1st October
1657, speaking of the instrumental music<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
he had heard there, says that it &#8220;is much
better than I expected. The organ and violin
they are masters of, but the bass-viol they have
not at all in use, and, to supply its place, they
have the bass-violin.&#8221; According to Maugars
in his &#8220;Reponse fait à un curieux ...&#8221; (1639)
the viol was going out of use in Italy, quite
twenty years before the above date. &#8220;Regarding
the viol,&#8221; he remarks, &#8220;there is no
one in Italy now who excels on that instrument,
and even in Rome it is still little cultivated: I
am very astonished at this, seeing that they had
formerly one Horatio de Parme, who was a
marvellous player.&#8221; The writer of these lines
was himself a magnificent performer on the
viola da gamba. He visited Rome, where he
found the gamba, the theorbo, and harpsichord
the most fashionable instruments, and, in spite of
the numerous violins and violoncellos being made
by Nicolas Amati in his busy workshops in
Cremona, these latter were considered to be
what Lord Chesterfield would have called &#8220;ungentlemanly
instruments.&#8221; If by chance any
enthusiastic amateur was rash enough to adopt
the violin, he was careful to hide the fact from
his friends for fear of being thought disreputable.
This antipathy to the fiddle was just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
as keenly felt in England, when the encroachment
of the new-fangled four-stringed instruments
began to endanger the position of the viol.
Anthony Wood, writing in 1653 at Oxford, says
in reference to this: &#8220;Before the Restoration,
gentlemen played three, four and five parts with
viols. They esteemed a violin to be an instrument
only belonging to a common fiddler, and could
not endure that it should come among them for
fear of making their meetings vain.&#8221; This prejudice
against the violin is even felt to-day by
many people. We ourselves remember an old
lady&#8217;s astonishment when we confided to her that
we could play the violin: &#8220;Why!&#8221; she exclaimed,
&#8220;I thought such instruments were only
played outside public-houses.&#8221;</p>

<p>The degree of excellence attained by such men
as the Abbé Maugars, Hoffman, Sainte Colombe,
and Marais, on the viola da gamba was certainly
detrimental to the development of the violoncello.
Maugars spent four years studying the gamba in
England in 1620, and when he visited Rome, in
1639, his performances at the house of Signora
Leonora Baroni, a famous Italian singer&mdash;who
was herself no mean performer on the harpsichord
and gamba&mdash;gained him the highest
eulogies, which he recounts with no uncertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
voice in the pamphlet already referred to (p. 138).
In the face of the prodigies performed by gamba
players, makers were content to follow the
times and allow the violoncello to retain its large
proportions. Even Stradivarius, who made the
violin what it now is, did not occupy himself
with the dimensions of the violoncello, but
adopted the measurements of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>A complete account of this maker&#8217;s violins and
violoncellos is to be found in Messrs Hill&#8217;s valuable
monograph &#8220;Antonio Stradivari, his Life and
Work.&#8221; In the chapter devoted to a <i>résumé</i> of
Stradivari violoncellos, they make the interesting
assertion that no violoncello by Stradivarius is
known to them previous to the year 1680. The
earliest dated instrument of the violoncello type
known to them was made by the great Cremona
master in his twenty-third year, 1667, and,
although it has been considerably altered, it
apparently originally contained many of the
features of the viola da gamba and violoncello.
They are of opinion that the instrument was
primarily strung as a gamba, which was doubtless
the case, for at that time it was customary to
make gambas in two forms&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> with flat back
and true viol-shaped upper bouts curving high
into the neck, and also in the violin form.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Christopher Simpson, the most renowned English
gamba player of his day, gives excellent representations
of both these forms of gambas (p. 80) in his
&#8220;Division Viol&#8221; (Second Edition, London, 1667).
He recommends the violin shape as superior to
the viol form for playing divisions on a ground
as &#8220;the sound should be quick and sprightly,
like a Violin; and Viols of that shape (the Belleys
being digged out of the plank) do commonly
render such sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another violoncello by Stradivarius, which
shows similar signs of alteration, belonged to Mr
Leo Stern in 1902. Its proportions, although
cut down by Dodd, are still of the largest, and
the presence of a fifth hole in the head for a peg
indicates that it was originally strung with five
strings. No doubt this was originally an extra
large viola da gamba of the form recommended
by Christopher Simpson. Messrs Hill also give
the interesting piece of information that they
are acquainted with a viola da gamba by Stradivarius,
or, to speak more correctly, with the
material which once formed one. The often
over-generous hand of the modern maker has
employed itself in adding fresh wood in all
directions with a view to transforming the instrument
into a violoncello. Brought from France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
to Italy in its original state, it may possibly be
the viol made by Stradivari in 1684 for the
Comtessa Cristina Visconti, the patterns of which
are preserved in the &#8220;Della Valle Collection.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still referring to Messrs Hill&#8217;s book we find
that Stradivarius made about thirty large-sized
violoncellos between the year 1680 and 1700
and that it was not until the latter date that he
shows any signs of turning away from the violoncello
of large proportions. Two instruments
which bear evidence of this important change of
construction are the Cristiani (1700) and the
Servais (1701). The first of these measures
30-1/2 bare inches in length, while the Servais
measures 31-1/8 inches, but even these proportions
were large as compared to the violoncellos he
made ten years later. The Cristiani is of
particular interest at the present moment as it
has recently become the property of the nation.
It originally belonged to a charming lady of that
name who gained repute as a professional
violoncellist in the forties of the nineteenth
century. Felix Mendelssohn paid her the compliment
of playing her accompaniments at her
concert at Leipsic, and dedicated one of his
&#8220;Songs without Words&#8221; to her. She was not
a great executant by any means, but the violoncello<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
at that date did not count so many women
players as it does in these days, and, then again,
she was possessed of much personal beauty, so
that her critics judged her in the same manner
as they did the handsome Madame Catalani, of
whom it was said that:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;If to her singing some few errors fall</div>
<div class="verse">Look in her face, and you forget them all.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Mdlle. Cristiani&#8217;s violoncello&mdash;after her death
at Tobolsk, in Siberia, in 1853&mdash;fell into the
hands of M. Benazet, a Baden-Baden amateur.
Through the medium of Messrs Gand &amp; Bernadel,
it became the property of the eminent
violoncellist, Herr Hugo Becker, in 1884. Ten
years later Messrs Hill bought it, and still later
Mr Charles Oldham, a well-known ophthalmic
surgeon of Hove, Brighton, purchased it from
them. At the latter&#8217;s death, on the 24th
January 1907, he bequeathed the &#8220;Cristiani&#8221;
violoncello, together with the famous inlaid
&#8220;Rode&#8221; violin (1722), a violin of the Amatasie
period dated 1687, and the handsome inlaid viola
made by Stradivarius for Philip IV., of Spain,
in 1696, to the nation. These four instruments
have been confided to the care of the British
Museum, but it is to be devoutly hoped that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the authorities may find some clause in Mr
Oldham&#8217;s will, by which they may avoid the
necessity of placing them under a glass case.
There is no more melancholy object than the
violin or violoncello which is relegated to a
museum and compelled to silence. The handsome
violin by Stradivarius in the Musée of the
Paris Conservatoire, and Paganini&#8217;s violin in
Genoa&mdash;standing under a glass case like an
eight-day clock&mdash;are melancholy examples of
such a useless practice. It would be of much
more practical use to art, if wealthy connoisseurs
would follow the example of Mr John Rutson,
and leave their valuable collections of musical
instruments to some musical institution for the
use of gifted pupils unable to purchase a suitable
instrument for their public début and early
appearances. It is undeniable that, as a rule,
genius is poorly endowed with this world&#8217;s
goods, and often lacking in opportunity; thus
it is that many a gifted violinist or violoncellist
has been balked of success for lack of a good
instrument to play upon.</p>

<p>After the year 1700, Stradivarius made some
fine violoncellos, the most superb of all at the
present time, being the instrument he made in
his seventy-sixth year. This grand example is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
dated 1720, and, besides its intrinsic merits, it
has a special interest, having been the favourite
instrument of Signor Piatti. Many were the
hands through which it passed before finding a
safe haven with the gifted Italian violoncellist to
whom it was presented by Colonel Oliver in
1867. Like Ole Bull and his Gasparo da Salo,
Piatti was enamoured of the violoncello the
moment he saw it, on a visit to Dublin, during
the first year of his sojourn in England in 1844.
Its memory lived in his mind for years, and he
longed to possess it. The most consummate of
storytellers and most genial of men, Piatti was
never weary of recounting the romantic manner
in which his violoncello crossed his path from
time to time, and how he wished to purchase it,
but was debarred from so doing by want of
sufficient capital. However, it was a case of
&#8220;Kismet.&#8221; He did eventually become its proud
possessor, and like a pair of lovers they found
no hardship in overcoming obstacles together.
The career of this instrument is traced by
Messrs Hill from the year 1818, when it
was brought to this country from Cadiz, by a
wine merchant named Mr Dowell. For
300 guineas it passed into the hands of the
Rev. Mr Booth, who&mdash;like Mr Dowell&mdash;was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Irishman. The purchase was effected through
the medium of Paul Alday, an Irish violinist,
whose name is responsible for the story that he
was once so lost in the labyrinths of a seemingly
endless <i>cadenza</i> at a concert, that an exasperated
member of the audience exclaimed: &#8220;Well,
Mr Alday, are you going to play <i>all night</i>!&#8221;
Ten years after Mr Booth became the possessor
of the violoncello, another change of ownership
took place at a sale by auction at Messrs Cramer
&amp; Beale&#8217;s where a well-known Dublin violoncellist,
Mr Piggot, purchased it. The sum paid
by the latter is unknown to Messrs Hill, but
from some notes kindly supplied us on the
subject by Comtessa Lochis&mdash;Signor Piatti&#8217;s
daughter&mdash;through the medium of Mr Whitehouse,
the statement that &#8220;it was sold for £100
to a professor of Dublin,&#8221; may allude to the
price paid for it by Mr Piggot. After Mr
Piggot&#8217;s death, in 1853, Sir Robert Gore Booth,
an amateur violoncellist, undertook the sale of
the instrument for his deceased friend&#8217;s widow,
and, bringing it to London, invited Piatti to come
and see it. As soon as Piatti beheld the
violoncello, he recognised it to be the exquisite
instrument he had seen in 1844, and never
forgotten. Great was his chagrin at being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
unable to purchase it, but at the time it was
impossible. By his advice, however, the violin-maker,
Maucotel, went to see it, and managed
to obtain it at a bargain for £300, and shortly
after Colonel Oliver bought it of Maucotel for
£350. To Piatti&mdash;already a frequent visitor at
Colonel Oliver&#8217;s house&mdash;the Stradivarius violoncello
was a still further attraction, especially as he
could play on it whenever he felt inclined. He
used to care for it like a child, and at length, on
a memorable day in the year 1867, he was at
the Colonel&#8217;s house, occupied in comparing the
Stradivarius&#8217; merits with that of a violoncello
by the brothers Amati and another by Montagnana,
when Colonel Oliver suddenly inquired&mdash;&#8220;Which
do you prefer?&#8221; Piatti at once
indicated the Stradivarius without hesitation.
His astonishment and embarrassment were unbounded
when in reply to this conclusion, the
Colonel said laconically: &#8220;Take it home then!&#8221;
But nothing would induce the simple-minded
<i>virtuoso</i> to accept the Colonel&#8217;s offer, and after
thanking him, he left the house hurriedly,
fearing that his great longing for the violoncello
might make his refusal &#8220;tremble in the
scale.&#8221; Scarcely had he arrived home, however,
when the violoncello was brought to his door, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
from that day to his death remained with him
always.</p>

<p>It was on this grand Stradivarius that Piatti
delighted audiences week after week, and month
after month, at the Saturday and Monday
Popular Concerts, (now, alas!&mdash;be it said to our
shame&mdash;dwindled out of existence for want of
support) and it was on New Year&#8217;s day, 1901&mdash;six
months before his death&mdash;that he played his
<i>Swan Song</i> (the &#8220;Danza Moresca&#8221;) before a
party of friends at his daughter&#8217;s house, with
all his accustomed skill and brilliancy. Although
it is not part of our subject here to detail the
lives of violoncello players, yet we cannot leave
this artist, so beloved in England, without
mentioning the touching tribute to his memory,
which is celebrated annually by his resting-place,
in the private chapel of the Lochis family. The
funeral, which was a public one, attended by the
Prefect, the Mayor, and representatives of the
leading Musical Societies of his native town of
Bergamo, took place on the 22rd of July 1901.
In spite of the tempestuous weather, hundreds
of townsfolk and people from the neighbouring
provinces turned out to do homage to their
esteemed countryman. Four professors, from
the Music School at Bergamo, played the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Andante from Schubert&#8217;s Quartet in D minor,
according to the last wishes expressed by Piatti,
and a week later again visited the Lochis Chapel,
where they made a solemn compact to meet each
year, and perform the same Andante on the
anniversary of the master&#8217;s death. Thus is
the memory of the great artist, whose lovable
nature made him a boon companion and
cherished friend, reverently preserved.</p>

<p>Signor Piatti&#8217;s violoncello at his death passed
into the hands of his daughter, Countess Lochis,
who, although realising that it was a precious
relic of her father, still felt that it would harm
the instrument if she kept it without being
played upon. She therefore accepted the offer
of Herr Robert Mendelssohn, the Berlin banker,
and sold it to him for £4000. Herr Mendelssohn,
who is the nephew of the composer of
that name, is himself an excellent amateur
violoncellist, and, in conjunction with his brother,
owns a fine Quartet of Strads. During the
latter years of Signor Piatti&#8217;s life he had offered
him £2000 for the violoncello, but had, on the
sum being refused, asked Piatti to name his own
price. But the Italian violoncellist stubbornly
refused to part with the instrument although he
no longer played in public. However&mdash;as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
have seen&mdash;the violoncello did become the property
of Herr Mendelssohn, who has the distinction
of paying the largest sum ever given
for a violoncello.</p>

<p>No better or more complete account of
Stradivarius&#8217; violoncellos is to be found than in
Messrs Hill&#8217;s monograph already referred to.
The merits of such famous instruments as the
&#8220;Duport,&#8221; the &#8220;Mara,&#8221; the &#8220;Romberg,&#8221; the
&#8220;Bata,&#8221; the &#8220;Vaslin,&#8221; etc., are skilfully described,
as well as the sums paid for them, and
it is therefore hardly fair to repeat the many
facts there stated, but before leaving the
subject we are sorely tempted to repeat the
well-known romantic episode which occurred in
the career of the Stradivarius violoncello known
as the &#8220;Bass of Spain.&#8221; It is our English
dramatist, Charles Reade, who recounts the
adventure in one of his letters to <i>The Pall Mall
Gazette</i>, of the year 1872. This was the date&mdash;it
may be remembered&mdash;of the Special Loan
Exhibition of Musical Instruments at the South
Kensington Museum. Connoisseurs occupied
themselves in scouring Italy to gather together
all the most important and interesting specimens
they could lay hands on, and it was at this exhibition
that the violoncello&mdash;then the property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
of M. Galley&mdash;of which we here have a picture&mdash;was
shown (p. 124). Charles Reade, who had
learnt pretty well all that could be known about
fiddle-making from a certain &#8220;Henri&#8221;&mdash;a past
master in the art, but a rampant little revolutionary,
whom he met, by chance, at one of his favourite
Bohemian restaurants in Soho&mdash;wrote some
brilliant criticisms on the examples of ancient
Italian <i>lutherie</i> there displayed. In these articles,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
the author of &#8220;Peg Woffington,&#8221; took the
opportunity of expounding his theory of the
Cremona varnish&mdash;the most successful explanation
of the concoction ever attempted&mdash;and
amongst much fiddle lore, gives the following
account of the vicissitudes of the &#8220;Bass of
Spain,&#8221; made in the year 1713. It was formerly
in the collection of Mr John Adam, later
in that of the Duc de Camposelice, and was in
the possession of Mr Franklin Singer in 1902:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nearly fifty years ago a gaunt Italian called
Luigi Tarisio arrived in Paris one day with a lot
of old Italian instruments by makers whose
names were hardly known. The principal
dealers, whose minds were narrowed, as is often
the case, to three or four makers, would not deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
with him. Monsieur Georges Chanot, younger
and more intelligent, purchased largely, and
encouraged him to return. He came back next
year with a better lot; and yearly increasing
his funds, he flew at the highest game; and in
the course of thirty years imported nearly all
the finest specimens of Stradivarius and Guarnerius
France possesses. He was the greatest
connoisseur that ever lived or ever can live,
because he had the true mind of a connoisseur
and vast opportunities. He ransacked Italy
before the tickets in the violins of Francesco
Stradivarius, Alexander Gagliano, Lorenzo
Guadagnini, Geofredus Cappa, Gobetti, Morgilati
Morella, Antonio Mariani, Santo Maggini,
Matteo Benti of Brescia, Michel Angelo Bergonze,
Montagnana, Thomas Balestrieri Storioni,
Vicenzo Rugger, the Testori, Petrus Guarnerius
of Venice, and full fifty more, had been tampered
with, that every brilliant masterpiece might be
assigned to some popular name. To his immortal
credit, he fought against this mania and
his motto was, &#8216;A tout seigneur tout honneur.&#8217;
The man&#8217;s whole soul was in his fiddles. He
was a great dealer, but a greater amateur. He
had gems by him no money would buy from
him....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>&#8220;Well, one day Georges Chanot, senior, who is
perhaps the best judge of violins left, now Tarisio
is gone, made an excursion to Spain, to see if he
could find anything there. He found mighty
little. But, coming to the shop of a fiddle-maker,
one Ortega, he saw the belly of an old
bass hung up with other things. Chanot rubbed
his eyes, and asked himself, was he dreaming?
The belly of a Stradivarius bass roasting in a
shop-window! He went in, and very soon
bought it for about forty francs. He then
ascertained that the bass belonged to a lady of
rank. The belly was full of cracks; so, not to
make two bites of a cherry, Ortega had made
a nice new one. Chanot carried this precious
fragment home and hung it up in his shop, but
not in the window, for he is too good a judge
not to know the sun will take all the colour out
of that maker&#8217;s varnish. Tarisio came in from
Italy, and his eyes lighted instantly on the Stradivarius
belly. He pestered Chanot till the latter
sold it him for a thousand francs and told him
where the rest was. Tarisio no sooner knew
this than he flew to Madrid. He learned from
Ortega where the lady lived, and called on her
to see it. &#8216;Sir,&#8217; says the lady, &#8216;it is at your
disposition.&#8217; That does not mean much in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Spain. When he offered her to buy it, she
coquetted with him, said it had been long in her
family; money could not replace a thing of that
kind, and in short, she put on the screw, <i>as she
thought</i>, and sold it to him for about four thousand
francs. What he did with the Ortega
belly is not known&mdash;perhaps sold it to some
toothpick trade. He sailed exultant for Paris
with the Spanish Bass in a case. He never let
it out of his sight. The pair were caught by a
storm in the Bay of Biscay. The ship rolled;
Tarisio clasped his bass tight, and trembled.
It was a terrible gale, and for one whole day
they were in real danger. Tarisio spoke of it
to me with a shudder. I will give you his real
words for they struck me at the time, and I have
often thought of them since:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Ah, my poor Mr Reade, the Bass of
Spain was all but lost.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Was not this a true connoisseur? a genuine
enthusiast? Observe! there was also an
ephemeral insect called Luigi Tarisio, who
would have gone down with the bass; but that
made no impression on his mind. <i>De minimis
non curat Ludovicus.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;He got it safe to Paris. A certain high
priest in the mysteries, called Vuillaume, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the help of a sacred vessel called a glue pot,
soon re-wedded the back and sides to the belly,
and the bass being now just what it was when
the ruffian Ortega put his finger in the pie, was
sold for 20,000 francs (£800). I saw the
Spanish bass in Paris twenty-two years ago....&#8221;</p>

<p>Under the impression that this Stradivarius
violoncello he so much admired at the South
Kensington Exhibition of 1872 was the &#8220;Bass
of Spain,&#8221; Charles Reade begins his next letter,
dated 27th August 1892, with a eulogistic account
of its beauties. In reality the instrument
was not the &#8220;Bass of Spain,&#8221; but the fine violoncello
made in the year 1725 which we see in
the picture before us (see p. 124). There is
no doubt about the handsomeness of this violoncello.
The scroll is most elegant, the purfling
perfection, the varnish transparent orange colour.
The front table is made of a well-chosen piece
of pine, but it is much cracked, and these cracks
have not been too skilfully mended. Its length
is the same as that of Signor Piatti&#8217;s violoncello,
29-7/8 inches, but the rest of the proportions are a
little different. In the hands of M. Vaslin, this
violoncello experienced the trials of a fidgety
master. It was for many years the faithful
companion of this excellent French violoncellist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
who obtained it from a Florentine banker through
his friend and fellow-artist, M. Girard, the
violinist. M. Vaslin found no fault with his
violoncello, until the latter part of his life, when
he felt convinced that something was wrong
with its neck. Times out of number the neck
was altered by some of the best <i>luthiers</i> of the
day, but still the aged violoncellist was not satisfied,
and at length resorted to the expedient of
tinkering it up himself. At length, in 1869,
M. Galley saved it from further torture by persuading
M. Vaslin to sell it to him. The bargain
was not completed until M. Galley had handed
over his own Stradivarius, valued at £400, at
the same time paying £600 in cash.</p>

<p>The devious and romantic ways in which fine
instruments have become the property of famous
artists would fill an interesting volume in themselves,
as would also the swindling practices
of which they have been the innocent cause.
The famous violoncellist, Herr Karl Davidoff,
became possessed of his grand Stradivarius entirely
through the medium of his magnificent
talent. His instrument was originally the property
of Count Wielhorskey, a Russian amateur
violoncellist, who had a passion for collecting
musical instruments. For some reason or other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
it suddenly dawned on this Russian nobleman
that it was impossible to play on all the instruments
in his store at once, and that they
could not improve standing like waxwork figures
under glass cases. So, he conceived the brilliant
idea of instituting a competition, the winner of
which was to be rewarded with the Stradivarius
violoncello. Karl Davidoff was just then touring
in Russia and he heard of the Count&#8217;s
challenge. At once he entered himself as a
competitor, and, being then at the zenith of his
glory, it was only natural that he should carry
off the prize easily. He kept it until the end
of his life, but it bears many a mark of his
rough usage.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned Count Wielhorskey
also owned a fine-toned violoncello, which he
usually alluded to affectionately as &#8220;<i>the</i> Amati.&#8221;
This instrument, we believe, was in reality a
Ruggieri, but to the Count it was always &#8220;<i>the</i>
Amati.&#8221; It belonged originally to a Florentine
lady of noble birth of the name of Renoncini,
and through the instigation and enthusiasm of
a certain Italian named Francesco Ciandi, himself
a violoncellist in the orchestra of the
Italian Opera House at St Petersburg, was
brought from its southern home to the Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
court. The Emperor Nicolas presented it to
Count Wielhorskey knowing him to be passionately
devoted to violoncello playing. It became
the Count&#8217;s favourite instrument, and he scarcely
played on any other until old age cramped his
fingers and forced him to give up playing entirely.
Then, as in the case of the Stradivarius,
being averse to sticking it up under a glass case,
he presented it to Franz Knetch, solo violinist
in the court orchestra, who recounts the gift in
his diary under the date 30th October 1850:
&#8220;To-day Count Wielhorskey presented me with
&#8216;<i>the</i> Amati&#8217; violoncello.&#8221; He also became
greatly attached to the instrument and bequeathed
it to his sister, who, after his death,
was anxious to give it to a museum. But
apparently it was again saved from the waxwork
type of existence, as Herr Ludwig Grutzmacher,
the far-famed violoncellist, played on it for over
forty years, and called it &#8220;My Amati.&#8221; The
present owner of this fine instrument we believe
is a wealthy gentleman in Hamburg.</p>

<p>One of the finest violoncellos made by Nicolo
Amati came into Herr Klengel&#8217;s possession after
a good many years of obscurity. The story
runs that a young Russian student at Leipsic,
discovering his finances to be in a very exhausted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
condition, bethought himself of a
violoncello which had been in his family for
many years, but about which he knew nothing.
Thinking that the old instrument might possibly
have some value, he boldly took it to a pawnbroker&#8217;s
on the chance, and demanded a loan
of £5 on it. The pawnbroker in his turn was
unable to estimate whether the violoncello was
worth such an amount, and, to be on the right
side, consulted some experts before giving a
reply. The experts quickly realised that they
had a very fine Nicolo Amati violoncello before
them, and through the medium of the pawnbroker
offered the young student £200 if he
would sell the violoncello outright. The sum
was agreed to by the delighted young Russian.
Twenty-four hours after he sold it, Herr Klengel
became its owner for about double that sum.
Profits in the fiddle trade are certainly swift,
but they are not always honest.</p>

<p>Speaking of pawnbrokers, by the way, it
is not often that they meet their match in
shrewdness. One of the neatest swindles ever
perpetrated took place in New York a few
years ago, and victimised a well-known, &#8220;three-balls&#8221;
gentleman to the extent of over £30.
According to <i>The New York Sun</i>, it was one day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
in May 1902, that a well-known pawnbroker
of Allen Street was visited by a shabbily
dressed man who asked for a loan on his violin
and bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I vas a blayer from Poland,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
my fiddle vas most waluable. I vouldn&#8217;t lose
it for anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pawnbroker offered him something like
a guinea on it, and the young violinist accepted
it, saying at the same time: &#8220;Don&#8217;t wrab it
up. Chust hang it ub der for I vil come and
taig it out to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fiddle according to his request was not
wrapped up, but placed on a shelf behind the
counter. The next day a man with long black
hair streaming over his shoulders, and wearing
gold-rimmed glasses, entered the pawnshop to
inquire the price of some silver-ware. He
turned it about, found it was not what he
wanted, and, chancing to see the fiddle, asked
if he might look at it. The violin and bow
were handed to him for inspection and he began
to examine them critically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;at last I haf foundt
von of dem! Gott in Himmel! but it is a
grandt one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A grand what?&#8221; asked the pawnbroker.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>&#8220;A real genuine Rubinsky violin,&#8221; replied the
enraptured foreigner, and whipping it quickly
under his chin began suddenly to play.</p>

<p>The more he played the more the pawnbroker
became convinced that the instrument was extraordinarily
valuable.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will sell dis fiddle to me,&#8221; said the
player, pausing, &#8220;I vill gif you tree hundredt
dollars for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; said the pawnbroker, &#8220;because
it is not mine to sell. It was only pledged
yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>The violinist thereupon demanded the address
of the owner, but the pawnbroker, seeing the
chance of a &#8220;deal,&#8221; said he could not do that,
but, instead, he himself would see the proprietor
of the fiddle and ask him if he would sell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ferry vell,&#8221; said the Polish virtuoso, &#8220;here
is dwenty dollars to bint the pargain. Eef he
vill sell, I vill bay the pallance ven I kome to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mein Gott!&#8221; said the owner of the violin
when the pawnbroker visited him the same
evening and approached him on the subject of
buying the instrument. &#8220;I could not pard vid
the violin for less than two hundert dollars. It
kost me fife hundert tollars in Polandt.&#8221; The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
two men sat some time bickering about the sum
expected and the sum offered, and at length the
pawnbroker laid down $200 and departed with
the delightful intention of asking <i>his</i> customer
$280.</p>

<p>The next day passed, however, without the
expected visitor putting in an appearance.</p>

<p>Also the day following passed in the same
manner, and the next and the next.</p>

<p>At last the pawnbroker felt a twinge of
anxiety. He flew to the address given him by
the would-be purchaser and found that no such
person was known there. A visit to the house
of the former owner of the violin also proved
fruitless, for the bird had flown.</p>

<p>The pawnbroker, it is said, did not seek
sympathy, well knowing that none is extended
to his fraternity, but he occupied himself for
some months in trying to straighten his accounts.
We could easily light upon numerous tales of
swindles in the fiddle trade without difficulty,
but as our time is now short, we will content
ourselves with quoting this one anecdote, and
return to Cremona and its <i>luthiers</i>.</p>

<p>Contemporary with Stradivarius, Italy claimed
many fine fiddle-makers, indeed, as a matter of
fact, there was scarcely a town in Italy that did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
not possess some adept at the art. In Cremona
itself there were many who lived almost at the
threshold of Stradivarius&#8217; house. Next door
to him were the Begonzi family, and adjoining
them was the house of Andreas Guarnerius.
Then, but a few steps away in the busy square
of St Domenico&mdash;now the <i>Piazza Roma</i>&mdash;Ruggieri,
Amati, and Storioni had their workshops.
They must have been a hardy lot to
remain and compete with the gigantic industry
and talent of Stradivarius, but they came through
the ordeal in some cases grandly. Andreas
Guarnerius, for instance, was a steady workman,
who made several violoncellos, though nothing
calculated to &#8220;strike one all of a heap.&#8221; One of
his best violoncellos was that which was preserved
for many years in Mr Gillot&#8217;s collection, but
even this did not command a higher sum than
£73 (including a nameless Italian violoncello),
at the sale by auction which took place after Mr
Gillot&#8217;s death in April 1872. Another violoncello
by the redoubtable Andreas belonged to
Beethoven&#8217;s patron, Prince Joseph Francis
Maximilian. This instrument, with several
other interesting gambas and lutes, was found
in the old chapel of the deserted castle of Prince
Lobkovitz in the last days of October, 1872,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
curiously enough but six months after the sale
of Mr Gillot&#8217;s Guarnerius. The instrument discovered
in the chapel was considered so excellent
that it was selected to be shown in the
Cremonese section of the Vienna Exhibition in
that year.</p>

<p>Peter Guarnerius, brother of Andreas&#8217; son
Joseph, also worked in Cremona during the
latter years of Stradivarius&#8217; life. He made some
especially good violoncellos, large and broad in
model, with original, well-cut scrolls, and excellent
purfling and varnish. He got hold of some
grand timber, which he used for the bellies of
many of his violoncellos; wood wide in grain,
but beautifully even. We saw a handsome
violoncello by this maker but a few days ago
in the hands of Miss May Fussell, who has
employed it for all her concert work since
1894. The tone is full and rich.</p>

<p>In the same city another eminent maker, the
eldest member of a large family of <i>luthiers</i>,
Francesco Rugger, was a worthy rival of Stradivarius.
He occupied a prominent position as
a maker, and inscribed himself on his tickets
&#8220;Francesco Rugger detto il Per, Cremona,
16&mdash;&#8221; Various definitions of the true significance
of the <i>il Per</i> adopted by Rugger have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
been put forth. Some claim that he thereby
announced himself as the &#8220;eldest&#8221; or &#8220;father,&#8221;
others that it alluded to his partiality for pear-tree
wood as material for his instruments.
Read literally, one might easily imagine that
the &#8220;il Per&#8221; belonged to some catch phrase
or proverb, possibly a nickname by which the
maker was familiarly known to his friends. All
the old fiddle-makers adopted some trade-mark&mdash;generally
extracted from the calendar of saints&mdash;Rugger&#8217;s
&#8220;il Per&#8221; might therefore have been
a familiar sobriquet which acted for him in this
capacity.</p>

<p>The work of this maker is quite after the
Amati type, though in advancing this statement
we do not for a moment intend to charge him
with being a copyist. Delicacy, finished workmanship,
a graceful sound-hole, transparent
varnish well laid on, these are the chief characteristics
of Rugger&#8217;s work. Like Stradivarius,
he at first went with the times, modelling his
violoncellos on a large scale (31-5/16 inches in
length), but he appears to have seen the error
of his ways before his contemporary, as previous
to 1700 he made small violoncellos measuring
but a little over 28 inches in length.</p>

<p>An exceptionally fine violoncello of Francesco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Rugger was the cause of a lawsuit some years
ago, on account of its falling a victim to false
labelling, whereby it purported to be the work
of Antonio Stradivarius. This handsome instrument
belonged at one time to King George
IV., who was an enthusiastic amateur violoncellist
but scarcely an adept. There is a story
told that when King George was Prince of
Wales he played the violoncello one day before
Handel, and desiring to hear what the great
man thought of his performance inquired, &#8220;How
do you think I play?&#8221; It was impossible to
reply to such a question truthfully, coming as
it did from a royal interrogator, so the wily
Teuton had to temporise, &#8220;Like a Brince, your
Royal Highness,&#8221; he answered with warmth,
&#8220;like a Brince!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke of Cambridge was the next owner
of the pseudo Stradivarius, after which it passed
into the hands of Mr Corsby, by whom it was
sold to Mr Shuttleworth. In 1877, the same
instrument was sold by auction among the
collection of musical instruments put upon the
market by the death of Mr Parera of Manchester.
It figured in the catalogue as an
Antonio Stradivarius, and realised the sum
of £370.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>Several eminent artists have employed Francesco
Rugger&#8217;s violoncellos for concert work.
Ladislaus Zelenka, professor of the violoncello
at the Conservatoire at Odessa, and former
pupil of Herr Hugo Becker, possessed a very
fine violoncello by this maker. Mr Bertie
Withers has also an excellent &#8220;il Per&#8221; instrument
dated 1679, and the favourite violoncello
of the eminent English violoncellist, Mr
W. E. Whitehouse, is a very handsome, small-sized
Rugger, in a high state of preservation.</p>

<p>Pietro Giacomo Rugger, who was at work
in Brescia at the same time as Francesco of
the same name, pursued his labours in Cremona,
was another member of the family who made
violoncellos of modified dimensions. There are
so many points of similarity between his instruments
and those of Johannes Baptiste
Rugger, who worked both at Cremona and
Brescia, that conjecture credits them with joining
forces. The violoncellos of Giacomo are
distinguished by beautiful varnish and elegant
sound holes, but the scrolls lack breadth and
boldness. Signor Piatti owned a fine characteristic
example of this maker&#8217;s work which
passed into the possession of Miss Muriel
Handley. It is dated 1717. The gamut of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
prices realised from time to time by this violoncello
is one of the many revelations of the
caprices of fiddle dealing. Before Signor Piatti
became its owner, it had been sold for £30,
Piatti parted with it for £500 (!), and after
that it was insured for £800.</p>

<p>Milan boasted a favourite pupil of Nicolo
Amati, Paolo Grancino, an excellent violoncello-maker,
who, doubtless, was one of those who
found the competition too much for him in
Cremona and sought fresh fields. His instruments
are reminiscent of his master, the wood
and workmanship good, but the tone is hardly
suited to a concert hall. A better craftsman
was his son, Giovanni, who also practised his
art in Milan in 1703.</p>

<p>In Naples there was Alessandro Gagliano
whom the Prince Joussupoff, in his &#8220;Luthomonographie&#8221;
(Frankfort, S.M., 1856), announces
to have been the son of a marquis
of that name. According to this author,
Gagliano, at the beginning of the eighteenth
century, was compelled to flee from Naples, in
order to escape the vigilance of the police, who
were endeavouring to capture him on account
of a murder he had committed. The hunted
man withdrew to a forest in the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
of Marghanetto Borgo, and while there, passed
the weary hours&mdash;for want of better occupation&mdash;in
carving violin-shaped instruments on the
trunks of the trees. Discovering by this means
that his hand was apt at such work, he adopted
the profession of violin making, and as soon as
the police had grown weary of the pursuit
boldly established a workshop in Naples. We
cannot vouch for the veracity of this story;
fiddles have a trick of creating romances, but
Gagliano&#8217;s sojourn in the wood is generally
considered to have been the cause of his
excellently chosen pine, and good quality
sycamore.</p>

<p>Alessandro&#8217;s son, Nicolo, made some remarkably
good violoncellos resembling Stradivarius&#8217;.
The varnish is much darker than his father&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Venice claimed one of the best makers of
violoncellos of his time, in Stradivarius&#8217; pupil,
Domenico Montagnana. The &#8220;mighty Venetian,&#8221;
as Mr Charles Reade called him, found
the market too much monopolised by his
master, and after a short trial in Cremona
removed to Venice. He soon attained great
popularity there, and during the latter part of
Stradivarius&#8217; life sent out magnificent basses
and violoncellos from his workshop. His knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
of thicknesses, material, and varnish,
which he brought with him from the great
Cremona school, placed him head and shoulders
above his Venetian contemporaries. The gentle
curves of his model, the grandly cut scroll&mdash;which
even surpassed the beauty of his
master&#8217;s work&mdash;and, above all, the rich tone, are
the qualities which combine in making Montagnana&#8217;s
violoncellos perfect instruments. The
late Mrs Lewis Hill was the owner of one of
the finest known violoncellos by this maker.
It belonged for many years to the French
musician and composer, Félicien David (born
1810, died 1876), and after his death it was
sold to the well-known French violoncellist,
M. Francois of Douai, who retained it for some
years and then sold it to an amateur, Signor
Parenti, who ultimately sold it to Messrs Hill
&amp; Son. In 1902, Mr W. H. Squire purchased
it of that firm on behalf of Mrs Lewis Hill, in
whose possession it was employed to complete
her fine Quartet, consisting of two Stradivarius
violins, an Amati viola, and this violoncello.
The instrument is a typical example in every
way, the proportions being untouched, and is
now the property of Mr W. H. Squire, to whom
it was bequeathed by Mrs Hill.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>Rome claimed David Tecchler as the maker,
<i>par excellence</i>, in Stradivarius&#8217; time. He continued
to be the most prominent maker of that
city of dried bones and priests, for quite half-a-century,
and gained repute as a maker of
handsome basses and violoncellos&mdash;the latter
mostly large sized. He also gained experience
in Venice, and Salzburg, gathering his knowledge
of good timber from the first, and an
unfortunate stiff sound-hole from the second.</p>

<p>Returning to Cremona towards the latter
years of Stradivarius&#8217; life we find a new and
excellent maker&mdash;his pupil, Carlo Bergonzi&mdash;firmly
established near his master. At one
time he was deemed Stradivarius&#8217; best pupil,
whereas the Cremona master&#8217;s son, Francesco&mdash;whose
work has been frequently attributed to
Bergonzi&mdash;in reality surpassed his. The
beauty of form and rare quality of tone
which characterise Bergonzi&#8217;s violoncellos bear
testimony to the great school in which he was
trained. He believed in putting plenty of wood
in his instruments, a practice which has allowed
them to withstand the wear and tear of centuries
of usage better than those of many of his
contemporaries. The Manchester violoncellist
Herr Carl Fuchs&mdash;a favourite pupil of Davidoff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>&mdash;had
a grand Bergonzi violoncello, a couple of
years ago, and the instrument usually employed
for concert work by Mr W. H. Squire is also
a fine example of this maker, which he purchased
from the widow of Herr G. Libotton.</p>

<p>While all these makers were occupied in
developing the instrument itself, there were
other influences working to bring it to more
worthy uses. The rapid progress in violin
playing, and the establishment of a clearer and
better method of fingering, had its effect on the
violoncello. With a surer system of shifting
came a firmer grip of the hand and a more
sonorous tone. The old violists could think of
no other way of balancing the incongruity of
sound which existed between the &#8220;shrieking
violin&#8221; and its duller companion, than by the use
of double the number of bass-viols to prevent
its &#8220;outcrying&#8221; the lower parts. Never employ
the violin, cautions Thomas Mace, &#8220;but
with the proviso, viz. Be sure to make an
equal provision for them by addition and strength
of basses so that they may not outcry the rest
of the music (the basses especially).&#8221; A
thorough musician, and an artist, <i>jusque au
fond</i>, Corelli was one of the earliest composers
to realise the ineffectual use of the bass-viol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
with the violin; and did not scruple to discard
its services for that of the violoncello. Besides
his employment of it in his numerous sonatas
for <i>due violini e violoncello</i>, etc., he also adopted
the custom of an accompanying violoncello for
his solo performances. For a long time this
rôle of travelling about and accompanying
violinists, was played by violoncellists, who&mdash;although
they were not always exact in their execution
or accompanying&mdash;by this means, at least,
raised it out of its low position in the orchestras.
The possibilities of the instrument for solo purposes
began to suggest itself to performers, and
the shortcomings of the gamba more comprehended.
As early as 1691, tentative efforts
to bring the violoncello forward as a solo instrument
were being made, and a method, or treatise,
on the art of playing the instrument in this manner
was written by a gifted artist in Parma in that
year. Among the many works in connection
with this subject which we have perused, we
lately came across a rare pamphlet describing
three interesting old musical instruments&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> a
harp, a carved violin, and a carved violoncello&mdash;preserved
in the Museum Artistico Estense in
Modena. This little <i>brochure</i> came from the
pen of Count Valdrighi&mdash;one of the most industrious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and indefatigable of musical historians&mdash;and
was printed for private circulation only. It
is altogether a most fascinating little pamphlet,
and, although numbering but fifteen pages, lacks
none of the flowing metaphor and grace so indelibly
associated with Italian literature; moreover
the description of each instrument is supported by
excellent photographs. The exquisitely carved
violoncello of which we have a picture before us
(p. 174), owes its rich ornamentation to Domenico
Galli of Parma, a wood-carver of great repute at
the end of the seventeenth century and the beginning
of the eighteenth. According to Count
Valdrighi, Galli made this sumptuous violoncello
for Frances II., Duke of Modena, and presented
it to him together with a treatise on the violoncello
as a solo instrument entitled <i>Trattenimento
musicale sopra il violoncello a solo ausaciato all&#8217;
Altezza Serima de Francesco II. duc di Modena
Reggio</i>. The title-page of this interesting MS.,
which is preserved in the Bibliothèque of the
Estense Museum, is gracefully decorated by
Galli himself, and the date, 8th September 1691,
furnishes us with the information that this work
is the earliest known attempt at a method for
the violoncello. The wealth of carved ornamentation
on Galli&#8217;s violoncello and violin were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
designed with a special purpose. Thus, while
the exquisite little figure of Orpheus which
adorns the centre of the back of the violin
alludes to the peace enjoyed by the people of
Modena under the temperate government of
Frances II. and also to the musical tastes of the
Duke, the violoncello dabbles in politics and
religion. Hercules slaying the hydra is meant
to depict the character of the Duke&#8217;s nephew,
while the figure of Minerva with the cloak of
Pallas about her shoulders represents Mary
Queen of England, who had assumed her father&#8217;s
rights. The lions are symbolical of Mary&#8217;s
father, James II., at that time an alien under the
protection of Louis XIV., <i>Le Roi Soleil</i>, portrayed
by the sun supported by two figures, over the
carved form of Hercules. Besides the main
point which Galli strove to represent&mdash;namely,
a strong desire that the Catholic party might be
victorious and the house of Este restored to the
throne of England&mdash;the violoncello is covered
with delicately carved representations of all
things appertaining to the mineral, vegetable,
and animal world. Flowers, fruits, shells,
nymphs, satyrs, form a thickly encrusted background
to the main theme. The fairylike execution
of these is amazing, and worthy of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
Grinley Gibbons. If fault were to be found
it lies alone in the over-generous details of the
design, yet the whole is so skilfully wrought
that this cannot be looked upon as a defect.
Not a petal of the flowers, not a line in the
delicate shells, not a lock in the sirens&#8217; hair that
is not perfect, and well fitted to be the satellite
of the main scheme. The ribs of the violoncello
are as profusely covered with similar embellishments
as the back.</p>

<p class="caption">CARVED VIOLONCELLO BY GALLI.<br />

<span class="smcap">Modena, 1690.</span></p>

<p>Truly &#8220;a thing of beauty is a joy for ever,&#8221;
and time only increases its loveliness when it
is cherished. Galli&#8217;s <i>chefs-d&#8217;&oelig;uvre</i> will always
find admirers, as indeed will all the gracefully
decorated musical instruments of past centuries.
Look at this <i>gamba de luxe</i>, one can call it
nothing less, close beside us. Where will you
find more faultless inlaying in ivory and tortoise-shell?
Most pleasing to the eye, is it not?
Yet its very beauty exemplifies one of the
greatest pitfalls of the older <i>luthiers</i>. To the
ancient maker, ornamentation was as irresistible
as was the Lorelei&#8217;s golden hair to the sailors
of the Rhine. Most Italian makers had realised
the deleterious effects of inlaying and carving
before Stradivarius&#8217; time, but many of the great
Cremona master&#8217;s German contemporaries were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
still caught in its delusive toils. Dwelling in
Hamburg there was an unequalled stringed-instrument
maker named Joachim Tielke, who
fashioned his lutes of real ivory and ebony,
inlaid the necks thereof with gold, and silver,
and mother-of-pearl, while the pegs were formed
of the finest tortoise-shell. These lutes were
destined for the slim hands of the satin-clad
dilettanti of the day, who boldly faced the
many difficulties and intricacies of the instrument
for the sake of its beauty. According to
Mattheson,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> if a lutanist attained the age of
eighty, one might be certain that he had spent
sixty years in tuning; a tedious operation, as
the lute never remained long in tune. An
older writer, Thomas Mace, in his &#8220;Musick
Monument,&#8221; London, 1676, discussing the
shortcomings of the lute, seriously advises that
it should be kept, in the daytime, between the
rug and blankets of a bed which was constantly
used. It is hardly surprising that the exasperating
sensitiveness to atmospheric changes to
which this instrument was subject was at once
the delight and despair of its votaries, and that
makers observing these difficulties should attempt
to please their patrons by ornamenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
other less fragile instruments in lute fashion.
Tielke of Hamburg at all events transferred his
lute decorations <i>en bloc</i> to his gambas, as this
instrument and some others reveal.</p>

<p>The gamba of this make which is before us
has unfortunately been fitted by some vandal
with a machine head, but otherwise is as perfect
as when it left Tielke&#8217;s hands over three
hundred years ago. No doubt, the original
pegs were of ivory tipped with a dainty jewel
to correspond with those which were let into
the neck. Before it became the property of
the South Kensington Museum it was owned
by Mr Simon Andrew Forster, the joint author
of the well-known &#8220;History of the Violin.&#8221;
Two excellent pictures of this instrument are
included in this volume, and also the information
that Mr Forster purchased it from Mr
John Cause, the artist, who had lent it to the
directors of the &#8220;Ancient Concerts,&#8221; held in
the Hanover Square Rooms in the spring of
1845. These concerts were organised to take
place in this obsolete concert hall by a small
body of aristocratic music lovers headed by the
Prince Consort, and it was under his auspices
that the second concert of the season was not
only devoted to the sixteenth-century music, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
was performed on the ancient instruments themselves.
M. Fetis, at that time director of the
Brussels Conservatoire, supplied a number of old
instruments from the Musée of the Conservatoire,
and the orchestra on the evening of the 16th
April 1845, presented,&mdash;what <i>The Illustrated
London News</i> terms,&mdash;&#8220;a grotesque sight.&#8221;
There was a &#8220;Violino Francesi,&#8221; says the above
authority, a &#8220;viola da gamba&#8221; (now before us),
a &#8220;viola d&#8217;Amore,&#8221; and a &#8220;viola da Braccio,&#8221; a
&#8220;Theorbo,&#8221; &#8220;violino,&#8221; &#8220;guitar,&#8221; &#8220;harp,&#8221; and
an &#8220;organ,&#8221; played respectively by Messrs Loder,
Hatton, J. F. Loder, Ventura, Dragonetti, Don
Cubra, T. Wright, and Lucas. The complete
programme of the concert may be seen in full in
<i>The Illustrated London News</i> for 19th April 1845,
suffice it here to say that the two <i>pièces de
résistance</i> comprised a concerto, played on
Antique Instruments, and composed by Emile
del Cavalieri (1600), and an anonymous fifteenth-century
Romanesca, performed in a like manner.
Both Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort,
appeared to be highly delighted with the
concert, and at the end, invited Mr Hatton to
play a solo on his viola da gamba in the tea-room.</p>

<p>Since this galaxy of musical instruments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the past astonished Londoners, we have had
many other interesting attempts at recalling the
ancient viols to the concert platform, but notwithstanding
the success of these appearances,
there is no danger of the gamba ever getting
the upper hand of the violoncello again. The
latter has steadily taken its place as the leader
since the first half of the eighteenth century,
when the great Italian <i>luthiers</i> busied themselves
with its graceful form, and the performances
of Franciscello first enchanted Scarlatti in
Rome, and then astonished all Italy. From that
time until the present, makers and players have
gone hand in hand. Franciscello&#8217;s marvellous
achievements inspired others to emulate his
powers of attraction, among others Antonio
Vaudini, who was Tartini&#8217;s great friend and
travelled about with him for some time, for
the sole purpose of accompanying him. This
eccentric association of the high and low instruments
belonging to the string quartet led to
violoncellists adopting the system of fingering
employed for the smaller instrument. The old
way of holding the bow in the manner of the
viol players&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> as double-bass players frequently
hold it now&mdash;was also discarded for the
violinist&#8217;s method. Then Antonionetti of Milan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
and Lanzetti, violoncellist to the King of Sardinia,
published some sonatas for the violoncello, which,
according to Monsieur Vidal in his &#8220;Instruments
a Archét,&#8221; reveal that the capacities of the instrument
to the extent of an octave and a half
were known to them. Curiously enough, at
this point the zeal shown by the Italians in
developing the violoncello somewhat cooled, and
the important invention of employing the thumb
was left for the Frenchman&mdash;Berteau. A few
years before this violoncellist&#8217;s death in 1756,
Michael Corrette published his &#8220;Methode, theorique
et pratique, pour apprendre en peu de
temps le Violoncello ...&#8221; Paris, 1741, a work
which was the first of its kind. He still adhered
to the system of fingering the diatonic scale by
stopping whole tones with successive fingers,
and his remarks relating to the several systems
prevailing among violoncellists, together with
his instructions, for <i>three ways of holding the
bow</i>, are indicative of the unsettled state of
technique at that time. This condition of uncertainty
among players continued until towards
the end of the century when Jean Louis Duport
published his carefully written &#8220;Essai sur le
doigté du violoncelle, et sur le conduite de
l&#8217;archét.&#8221; This was the first method in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
the correct mode of fingering&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> a finger for
each successive semitone&mdash;appeared. Duport&#8217;s
system was too sound to be anything else than
universally adopted, and each successive writer
of violoncello schools&mdash;Romberg, Dotzauer,
Grutzmacher, etc.&mdash;have retained the fundamental
principles laid down by Duport. To-day
there is little executed by violinists that
virtuosos of the violoncello cannot accomplish,
if they are inclined,&mdash;but,&mdash;talking about the
obvious is always tedious especially at the end
of a long day, and we feel that it is nearly time
to bid you adieu. So much has already been
written by eminent writers on the subject of
makers and players subsequent to Stradivarius&mdash;of
the German, French, and English schools&mdash;that
it would be superfluous to give a descriptive
list of them here. The question as to
whether Jacobus Stainer and Joseph Guarnerius
del Jesu made violoncellos will always be one of
the many subjects to argue about. Yet, apparently
they have left evidence that they did make
violoncellos. This and other doubtful points
may be found adequately discussed in such
works as Laurent Grillet&#8217;s &#8220;Les Ancètres de
Violon,&#8221; George Hart&#8217;s &#8220;The Violin,&#8221; Anton
Vidal&#8217;s &#8220;Les Instruments a Archét,&#8221; Von<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Wasielewski&#8217;s &#8220;Die Violoncelle,&#8221; Luigi Farconi&#8217;s
&#8220;Il Violoncello, il violoncellesta e Violoncellesti,&#8221;
etc., and to those who seek to dig deeper for
themselves, there is the British Museum, and
the many Museums, and storehouses, of information,
to be found in every country.</p>

<p>Our chief aim during these chats has been to
seek out the uncommon rather than to preach,
therefore we will end as we have begun, and
before parting call your attention to the handsome
violoncello belonging to that gifted artist
Herr Paul Ludwig, made by a maker of the name
of &#8220;Chioddi&#8221; of whom we can find no record,
and as we bid you a regretful adieu, present you
with the history of two eminent women gamba
players, and the first violoncello prodigy known
in this country.</p>

<p>The fog has cleared and we may now dash
through endless slush to our respective homes.
The pleasant hours are over, let us hope for
future meetings, but if this may not come to
pass, the memory of to-day will be ever cherished
by us.</p>

<p class="center">Two Eighteenth-century Women Players of the Viola
da Gamba</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Empress of Germany well defined the attainments
of Pericles&#8217; ideal woman&mdash;who was to
be prized if no one spoke of her either in praise
or blame&mdash;when she announced that a woman&#8217;s
life should be made up of clothes, children,
cooking and church. A century or so ago,
such a statement would have been quite unnecessary,
for our great-grandmothers welcomed
each of these obligations as the sweetest duties
of life. But, somehow, for some unaccountable
reason, much of woman&#8217;s tender grace seems to
have faded with the Victorian era, and to-day
&#8220;<i>nous avons changé tout cela</i>.&#8221; Children, clothes,
cooking, are the very things&mdash;except the clothes&mdash;that
the modern woman, with her club and
other interests, deals with most lightly. She
would far rather rush into the battle of life and
fight like her Amazon ancestry. She would far
rather assume some definite career like her
brethren of the sterner sex. Perhaps she does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
not cut quite such a good figure as she did fifty
years ago, but her unceasing efforts to attain
prominence have revealed her to be dowered,
now and again, with an intellect capable of undertaking
all the duties dear to her departed sisters,
and rendering service in other provinces besides.</p>

<p>The emancipation of woman is a steady growth,
and to-day there are few professions in which
she does not compete side by side with man. In
the rough and tumble of the battle, she must
lose much of her ephemeral qualities, but, fortunately,
there are careers open to her in the
sphere of Art where her feminine evanescence is
the principal charm of her work. In music more
especially, her emotional value and quick instinct
are indispensable, and here she retains her personality
with ease. Whatever may be the
general opinion of woman&#8217;s work in the realm
of musical composition, her success as an executant
is undeniable. She cannot perhaps build
Masses like Bach, or Oratorios like Handel,
but she can interpret the works of the great
masters with much spontaneous insight, and one
cannot forget that she has written some of our
most popular songs. &#8220;Annie Laurie&#8221; was the
work of Lady Jane Scott; Lady Arthur Hill
wrote &#8220;In the Gloaming,&#8221; and Lady Scott Gattie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
composed the widely-known ballad &#8220;Douglas,
Tender and True.&#8221; &#8220;The Campbells are comin&#8217;,&#8221;
&#8220;The Land o&#8217; the Leal,&#8221; and &#8220;The Laird o&#8217;
Cockpen&#8221; were all the work of Lady Nairne,
while the languorous melody of &#8220;Juanita&#8221; emanated
from Mrs Elizabeth Morton&#8217;s pen. Undoubtedly
woman&#8217;s most appropriate place in
music is as a singer, for, look back as far as you
will, you will find her occupied in singing. The
Egyptian women danced and sang to the accompaniment
of clapping hands. The Hebrew
women pointed the story of their songs with
dramatic actions; they sang gaily at festivals,
and chanted dirges at funerals, and, although
the men&mdash;mark you&mdash;<i>might</i> join in if they felt
inclined to do so, yet the women were the acknowledged
leaders. Then, again, one of the
cherished duties of those graceful women&mdash;the
Greek Muses&mdash;was to sing songs at the banquets
of the immortals, and the principal occupation
of the Sirens, who sat upon rocks, was to
sing ditties to the passing mariners. The record
of woman&#8217;s singing is certainly ahead of man&#8217;s,
and it is regrettable that in these days she does
not continue to be ahead of him. It should be
woman&#8217;s prerogative to sing, while men could
monopolise the more technical branches of music,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
such as composing, and playing the flute and
string and brass monsters. Go to one of the
fashionable concerts devoted to that poor pale
thing, &#8220;The Modern Ballad,&#8221; and see if the
incongruity presented by six feet of muscular
manhood warbling about stars kissing, and moons
flirting, does not jar your sense of the fitness of
things. Listen to the same sentiments voiced
by a woman, however, and you will find the incongruity
vanishes, and mere trash becomes
sentiment.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately every woman is not blessed
with a melodious singing voice, yet the instinct
to sing being in her, she has turned to the best
imitation of the human voice she can find&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
the violin and the violoncello. To-day these
instruments, and even the viola, count innumerable
votaries, both professional and amateur,
among the fair sex, but who was the first brave
lady to &#8220;saw the catgut with the horse&#8217;s tail&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
history does not recount. Where history fails
however myth steps in and supplies us with
the information that the invention of producing
musical sounds from a stretched string originated
in the twang of Diana&#8217;s hunting bow.
Then the beautiful poetess Sappho&mdash;whose name
has been handed down to us much besmirched
for the reason that she was in advance of
her time&mdash;is assigned the honour of inventing
the fiddle-bow mounted with horse hair. St
Cecilia&mdash;whose name now graces numberless
Musical Societies&mdash;is said to have united instrumental
with vocal music in divine worship, about
the year 230. Little is known accurately of
this saint, but legendary lore pronounces her to
have been a noble Roman lady who embraced
Christianity, and was forced by her parents into
a union with a pagan named Valerian. She
eventually converted both her husband and his
brother to her faith, and they all three suffered
martyrdom for their convictions. The passing
phase in her history which relates that she frequently
united instrumental music with that of
her voice in praising the Lord, has inspired artists
to paint and mould her in an attitude of praise
with the organ and other musical instruments by
her side. Whether she played the viola da<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
gamba, or indeed any instrument, is a fact now
lost in oblivion; in any case Domenichino has
exquisitely represented her in the act of drawing
the bow across a handsome bass-viol in his immortal
picture now in the Louvre Collection in
Paris. After St Cecilia a prominent English
lady, who was the daughter of &#8220;Old King
Cole&#8221; of fiddling fame, was a skilled musician
according to Geoffrey of Monmouth. She is
apparently a solitary example of feminine musical
talent in England at that date.</p>

<p>The position occupied by woman in the music
of mediæval times had greatly deteriorated from
that occupied by St Cecilia, yet she was still
thought worthy of portrayal, and we find a
picture of her playing a viol with four strings
on the painted roof of Peterborough Cathedral,
which dates from about the year 1194. Two
years later the names of several lady minstrels
or &#8220;jongleuresses&#8221; figure in the code of laws
which the Corporation of Minstrels presented in
1321 to the &#8220;Prefect&#8221; of Paris for signature.
Heading the women is &#8220;Isabel la Roufelle,&#8221; and
after her &#8220;Marcel la Chastaine, Liegart, fame
Bieuveignant, Marguerite, la fame au Morne,&#8221;
etc., and lastly &#8220;Adeline, fame de l&#8217;Angloise&#8221; and
&#8220;Isabian la Lorraine.&#8221; The significant &#8220;fame&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
(wife) which occurs several times in the above
list helps us to a peep at the life of the
faithful spouse of the jongleur. Decidedly her
attainments as a female jongleur, roaming the
country with her husband, were absolutely
opposed to the dictum of Pericles. The lives of
these women were hard, and they were but poorly
paid in comparison to their male brethren. It is
on record that the Queen&#8217;s male &#8220;fiddler&#8221; in
1497 was paid &#8220;in rewarde&#8221; £1, 6s. 8d. while
the two shillings paid by Henry VIII. to &#8220;a
woman that singeth with a fiddle&#8221; is a pathetic
revelation of the proportionately low value set
upon woman&#8217;s artistic efforts at that time.</p>

<p>Among early amateurs of the bass-viol we
find Anne of Cleves, who frequently amused her
self by playing on a viol with six strings after
her retirement from the turgid trials of her
matrimonial life. The picture of a lady similarly
occupied, which occurs in a fifteenth-century
manuscript entitled &#8220;Les Echecs Amoreux,&#8221;
shows us that the French ladies were also
votaries of the viol at that time. In truth, the
bass-viol was then a very fashionable instrument
both in Europe and England. Shakespeare,
who echoed the doings of the day with unerring
exactitude, frequently employs the viol in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
synonymous sense as, for instance, in <i>Pericles</i>,
where the character that gives the title addresses
his daughter, Antiochus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;You&#8217;re a fair viol and your sense the strings</div>
<div class="verse">Who, finger&#8217;d to make man his lawful music,</div>
<div class="verse">Would draw heaven down.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Again in <i>Richard II.</i> the Duke of Norfolk, upon
realising the full despair of the word &#8220;banishment,&#8221;
bursts forth into the grand speech
beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;And now my tongue&#8217;s use is to me no more</div>
<div class="verse">Than an unstring&#8217;d viol or a harp.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>In <i>Twelfth Night</i> playing the viola da gamba
is mentioned as significant of good character.
When Maria calls Sir Andrew Aguecheek a
fool and prodigal, Sir Toby Belch defends him
with:</p>


<p class="center">&#8220;Fye, that you&#8217;ll say so! he plays o&#8217; the viol di
gamboys....&#8221;</p>

<p>In a ballad of the time of Charles I., which
occurs in Mr Chappelle&#8217;s book, &#8220;Music of the
Olden Time,&#8221; among the lady&#8217;s numerous
accomplishments it is recorded that:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;She sings and she plays</div>
<div class="verse">And she knows all the keys</div>
<div class="verse">Of the viol de gambo, or lute.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>In Mr Pepys&#8217; day, ladies cultivated the viola
da gamba with great zest, and were not frowned
upon for doing so, but the woman was bold
who dared to play the violin. Indeed, the antipathy
against that instrument for ladies was
still felt at the beginning of the nineteenth
century. Spohr, writing from Gotha in 1806,
mentions his beloved Dorette&#8217;s skill as a violinist.
But although admiring her aptitude for that
instrument he was averse to seeing his future
wife adopt it: &#8220;I advised her to discontinue
the practice of that instrument so unbecoming
to females,&#8221; he remarks in his most lofty
manner. Mr Pepys, under the date 6th June
1661, makes a similar allusion to women playing
the violin: &#8220;Here came two young gentlewomen
to see Mr Holland, and one of them
could play pretty well on the viallin, but how
these ignorant people did cry her up for it!&#8221;
Very different is the diarist&#8217;s manner of recounting
the performance of a certain Mrs Jaggard
on the viola da gamba: &#8220;After dinner I to the
office ... but business not coming we broke
up, and I thither again and took my wife ...
to visit my Ladys Jemimah and Paulina Montagu
and Mrs Elizabeth Pickering, whom we find
at their father&#8217;s new house in Lincoln&#8217;s In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Fields; but the house all in dirt. They received
us well enough; but I did not endeavour
to carry myself over familiarly with them; and
so after a little stay, there coming in presently
after us my Lady Aberguenny and other ladies,
we back again by coach ... and thence to
Jaggards again where a very good supper and
great store of plate, and above all after supper
Mrs Jaggard did at my entreaty play on the
Vyall, but so well as I did not think any woman
in England could and but few masters. I must
confess it did mightily surprise me, though I
knew heretofore that she could play, but little
thought so well.&#8221; Mr Pepys himself took keen
pleasure in playing the viol, and prided himself
in being the possessor of &#8220;as good a theorbo
viall and viallin as is in England.&#8221; Mrs Pepys
was also permitted by her lord to play the viol,
and a certain Mr Gregory, carefully selected by
Mr Pepys, &#8220;he being an able and sober man,&#8221;
gave her lessons. The third member of the
Pepys&#8217; <i>ménage</i> to play the viol was Mrs Pepys&#8217;
maid, the coquettish Mercer, who had as pretty
a talent for dancing a jig which, according to
the gallant Mr Pepys, &#8220;she does the best I
ever saw,&#8221; as playing on that instrument. Professional
lady gambists were apparently few in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
England in the eminent Diarist&#8217;s time, but in
France they already figured in the Musique
du Chambre du Roi, as a Mademoiselle Heléne
Sercamann is mentioned among the &#8220;Basses de
viole&#8221; in 1694. A year later there were three
lady &#8220;Basses de viole,&#8221; Mademoiselles de Caix
l&#8217;aîne, de Caix cadette, and de Caix troisième,
with their brother in the same band. The
French viola da gamba player, Sainte Colombe,
had two daughters who played with him at
concerts at his house. One of them, says
Titon du Tillet, played the viola da gamba and
the other the &#8220;dessus&#8221; or treble viol, and
together with their father they frequently
played trios.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century the cult of the
gamba amongst English ladies was at its height.
It became an indispensable piece of furniture
in every house, and no drawing-room was complete
without a viola da gamba hung upon the
wall, and oh! what a godsend it proved when
a dull visitor strained the hostess&#8217;s powers of
entertainment to their last point.</p>

<p>It was in this century that Dr Burney in his
colossal &#8220;History of Music&#8221; says: &#8220;This year
and the preceding year [1721-22], Mrs Sarah
Ottey frequently performs solos at concerts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
on three several instruments: harpsichord, bass-viol,
and violin.&#8221; Although this little paragraph
has been frequently quoted, no one
appears to have cared to peer deeper into Mrs
Ottey&#8217;s career. For some reason she has been
allowed to live solely on the reputation of these
few lines. Thanks, however, to the fact that
our British Museum owns Dr Burney&#8217;s valuable
collection of newspapers, the felicity of digging
up a little more of Mrs Sarah Ottey has been
possible to us. Apparently her first appearance
took place on the 9th March 1720, for <i>The
Daily Post</i> of 5th March of that year contains
the following advertisement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At Stationers&#8217; Hall, near Ludgate, on
Wednesday next being the 9th of March, will
be performed a Consort of Vocal and Instrumental
Musick by the best Masters. For the
benefit of Mrs Sarah Ottey, wherein she will
perform several Pieces alone on the Harpsichord,
Bass Viol, and Violin. To begin exactly at Six
a Clock. Tickets to be had at 5s. each, at
Mrs Anderson&#8217;s at St James&#8217;s-Gate, at Rosine&#8217;s,
White&#8217;s, and Williams&#8217;s Chocolate Houses, at Mr
Hare&#8217;s in Cornhill, Mrs Ottey&#8217;s in Honey-Lane
Market, and at the Hall-Door the said night.</p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>Her next important appearance took place
two years later at the &#8220;Theatre Royal in
Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Fields,&#8221; where she performed on
the three several instruments on the 27th of
February 1721. The entertainment was announced
&#8220;For the Benefit of Mrs Ottey.&#8221; A
year later she is advertised to play at the same
theatre, and the announcement gives the added
information that Mrs Ottey&#8217;s husband had
something to do with the &#8220;Carpenter&#8217;s Arms,&#8221;
and that it is her last appearance. These quaint
old advertisements are always amusing, so we
will not hesitate to give the announcement of
the fair gambist&#8217;s final appearance in full.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">For the Benefit of Mrs Sarah Ottey</span><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>At the Theatre Royal, in Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Fields,
on Tuesday being the 27th February, will be
perform&#8217;d a comedy call&#8217;d Love makes a man,
or The Fop&#8217;s Fortune, in which will be performed
several pieces of musick on the bass-viol, harpsichord
and violin by Mrs Ottey (being the last
time of her appearing in publick), with several
entertainments of dancing.</p>

<p>Tickets to be had at Mr William&#8217;s coffee-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
in St James&#8217;s Street, and at Mr Ottey&#8217;s at the
Carpenter&#8217;s Arms in Honey-Lane Market.</p></blockquote>

<p>Apparently Mrs Ottey&#8217;s career as an <i>artiste</i>
extended over but three years&mdash;that is, of course,
if we are to believe the announcement that it
was her last appearance in public on the 27th
February 1722/3. In these days such a statement
would imply that the said <i>artist</i> or <i>artiste</i> was
good for several farewell performances, and a
tour round the world as well. But the subjects
of King George I., being far removed from
twentieth-century customs, were perhaps more
veracious in their notifications. Mr and Mrs
Ottey having feathered their nest at the Carpenter&#8217;s
Arms, where the lady&#8217;s talented performances
were a great attraction to the patrons
of the tavern, a little stretch of the imagination
may easily see them migrating to a snug little
farm in the country, where their dreams of rose
bowers and new milk could be indulged in freely
for the rest of their lives. Whether this was
the true cause of Mrs Ottey&#8217;s withdrawal from
public life or not, we cannot say, but certain it
is that she kept her word, for there is no trace
of any further concert appearances in London
after the 27th February 1722/3.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>About fifteen years after Mrs Sarah Ottey&#8217;s
last bow to a London audience, a baby, who was
destined to become a beautiful and talented
woman, was presented to Thomas Ford by his
wife, <i>née</i> Champion. The auspicious event took
place in a house near the Temple, on the 22nd
February 1737, and created the usual stir among
the happy couple&#8217;s relations, who moved among
the <i>haute monde</i>. Thomas Ford himself was a
clerk of the arraigns, one of his brothers was
the Queen&#8217;s physician, and the other&mdash;Gilbert
Ford&mdash;occupied a high position as Governor-General
of Jamaica. As niece of two such
eminent men, and also being dowered with a
wealth of beauty and talent, Ann&mdash;as her
parents christened her&mdash;grew up among gentle
surroundings, and was received by, and made a
favourite of, the most fashionable society. Long
before she was twenty, she had tasted of the
intoxicating delights of admiration to an extent
which would have been sufficient to turn most
young girls&#8217; heads. Hone had painted her in
the character of a muse, the Earl of Chesterfield
had extolled her dancing, and many a lordly
<i>beaux</i> had fluttered at her feet. But although
she flirted, and played many a dangerous game
with her admirers, Ann Ford was endowed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
an intellect that sought for something else besides
the pastime of varied flirtations. &#8220;She is
excellent in music, and loves solitude,&#8221; wrote
one lord to another about her, &#8220;and has unmeasurable
affectations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not the least of these so-called &#8220;affectations&#8221;
alluded to by her adorer, were Ann Ford&#8217;s
musical gifts, which she developed with all the
powers of her culture-loving mind. Her voice
and singing were praised by the most excellent
critics of the day, and by many she was esteemed
to be quite equal to the favourite Mrs Billington
as a vocalist. In one respect, there is no doubt
that she surpassed the latter, for one of Ann
Ford&#8217;s most admired characteristics was the delightful
manner in which she could accompany
her songs on the guitar or viola da gamba.
Like attracts like, and it was only natural, the
talents of this clever lady in due course drew
the attention of the best musicians of the day.
She established a sort of musical <i>salon</i> which
was held each Sunday at her house, and to these
came Arne, Tenducci, Rauzzini, Pinto, and a
host of musical celebrities and fashionable
dilettanti. Nothing delighted the music-loving
hostess more than these weekly opportunities
of welcoming her artist friends, but there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
one sting to be found in her cup of happiness,
which took the form of her truly British parent,
Ford <i>père</i>. He objected strongly to his daughter&#8217;s
public display of her talents, and neglected no
opportunity of showing his disapproval. In
spite of his remonstrances, in spite of his displeasure,
his spirited daughter still continued to
hold her <i>réunions</i> each week, and also frequently
performed at her friends&#8217; houses.</p>

<p>The abrupt ending of a more than ordinary
<i>affaire de c&oelig;ur</i> with a married man, &#8220;a Person
of Distinction&#8221; brought the climax. Ann Ford
decided to fly in the teeth of her parent&#8217;s displeasure.
She would give a series of Subscription
Concerts at the Little Theatre in the Haymarket.
In vain did the father forbid the whole
thing, and finally resorting to threats, the daughter
flew from the paternal roof to the house of a friend.
Immediately Ford <i>père</i> procured a magistrate&#8217;s
warrant wherewith he secured the person of
his wayward child and brought her home. But
neither warrants, nor lock and key, could deter
Ann Ford from her purpose, and she managed
to elude her father&#8217;s vigilance and escape again.
The sensationalism caused by these incidents
brought friends old and new thronging round
the distressed lady. The heart of aristocracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
was touched, and the first of Ann Ford&#8217;s series of
subscription concerts on the 18th March 1760
furnished her with £1,500. Still her troubles
were not at an end, for her father, on the night
of the concert, employed a number of ruffians
to surround the theatre and these were only
dispersed by Lord Sackville&#8217;s threats to send for
a detachment of the Guards.</p>

<p>The programme of this first concert was
included in the following advertisement which
appeared in <i>The Public Advertiser</i> on the 17th
March 1760:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Miss Ford&#8217;s First Subscription Concert</span></p>

<p class="center">To begin at Seven o&#8217;Clock.</p>

<p>No more tickets will be delivered than the

<p>The second concert took place on the 25th
of March, when she is announced to take the
&#8220;Vocal Parts&#8221; and play &#8220;a solo on the Viol di
Gambo&#8221; as well as &#8220;a Concerto on the Guittar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Money being plentiful, the announcement of
Ann Ford&#8217;s third concert on the 7th April is
more lavishly displayed, the solo on the &#8220;Viol
di Gambo&#8221; being, in particular, inserted in large
type as a special attraction. For Monday, the
14th April, she requisitioned the services of
three other artists. The programme for this
concert appears in <i>The Public Advertiser</i> of Friday,
11th April 1760, in the following order:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Miss Ford&#8217;s Fourth Subscription Concert</span></p>

<p class="center">To begin at Seven o&#8217;Clock.</p></blockquote>

<p>Her fifth and last concert took place on
Tuesday, 22nd April, when, besides taking the
&#8220;vocal parts,&#8221; she played a solo and accompanied
herself in a song (&#8220;Oh! Liberty thou choicest
treasure&#8221;) on the Viola di Gambo, also performing
&#8220;a lesson on the guittar&#8221; and singing &#8220;a Hymn
set by herself,&#8221; which she accompanied on the lute.</p>

<p>These five concerts completed the series
announced and for the rest of that year Ann<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Ford abstained from further appearances on the
concert platform. During the interval, she
occupied herself in addressing a brilliant little
pamphlet to her former lover, which was
intended to contradict the scandalous imputations
which were being noised abroad concerning
her friendship with the married man. This
letter was published in 1761, under the title of
&#8220;A Letter from Miss F..d to a person of
distinction.&#8221; The pathetic manner in which she
chides his lordship for his attempt to overthrow
her virtue, and her gentle despair at his sudden unfriendliness
towards her, reads more like the attempt
of a clever woman to raise public sympathy
on her behalf rather than genuine dejection. The
&#8220;person of distinction&#8221; whom she addressed
replied to her in a somewhat derisive letter, in
which he endeavours to reveal Miss Ford&#8217;s <i>pique</i>
to arise from the fact, that he and his spouse
did not support her subscription concerts handsomely.
The publication of such letters certainly
did neither party good, though from the point of
view of literary excellence, Ann Ford surpassed
her lordly lover.</p>

<p>Having become entirely dependent on herself
through her direct opposition to her father&#8217;s
wishes, Ann Ford again made another bid for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
public favour at the end of the following year.
From the 24th to the 30th of October she was
announced to sing &#8220;English airs accompanying
herself on the musical glasses&#8221; daily in the large
room, Cock&#8217;s Auction-room, Spring Gardens,
and before the following year she published her
&#8220;Instructions for playing on the Musical Glasses.&#8221;
This was before the introduction of the &#8220;armonica&#8221;
by Marianne Davies, so that the instrument
employed by Ann Ford consisted simply of
a series of glasses containing various quantities
of water. This sort of art could have hardly
been to her taste, and she very soon threw it
up. In the following month she accompanied
her friends, Lady Elizabeth Thicknesse and her
husband, Philip Thicknesse, to Landguard Fort,
of which the latter was Lieutenant-Governor.
Shortly after their arrival Lady Thicknesse gave
birth to a son, whom she lived to see only a few
months old, as she died on the 28th March 1762.
Circumstances thus threw the whole care of the
child upon Ann Ford, and so devoted and sympathetic
a foster-mother did she prove herself to
be that, six months after his wife&#8217;s death,
Philip Thicknesse made Ann Ford his (third)
wife.</p>

<p>For some years after this event Ann Thicknesse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
lived a life of peaceful happiness, residing
in the summer months at Felixstowe Cottage.
This residence was the subject of an enthusiastic
article in &#8220;The School of Fashion,&#8221; 1800, and
Gainsborough&#8217;s sketch of it was published in
<i>The Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</i> (vol. ii. 1816).
During the years of her married life, Mrs
Thicknesse turned her attention to literature,
and while residing in Bath, from 1778 to 1781,
wrote her sketches of the &#8220;Lives and Writings
of the Ladies of France,&#8221; which filled three
volumes.</p>

<p>In 1792, an abrupt ending to this placid existence
was caused by the sudden death of
Philip Thicknesse at Boulogne, where Ann and
her husband had made a temporary halt on
their way to Italy. In spite of the danger entailed
by English people in France at that time,
Ann Thicknesse intrepidly remained in that
country after her husband&#8217;s death, and paid for
her temerity by arrest and confinement in a
convent, where she remained for two years.
With the execution of Robespierre and the
liberation of all prisoners who could prove themselves
capable of earning their own living, Ann
Thicknesse easily gained her liberty and returned
to England. In 1800 her novel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> &#8220;The School
of Fashion,&#8221; in which she introduced many well-known
characters under fictitious names (she
herself figuring under the guise of Euterpe) appeared.</p>

<p>The latter years of this brilliant woman&#8217;s life
were spent with a friend who lived in the Edgware
Road, and she died there, at the age of eighty,
on the 20th January 1824. It is given to few
to pass through such an eventful life as Ann
Ford&#8217;s, and live to such ripe years. Beautiful,
popular, a gifted linguist and musician, all these
conspired to make her a prominent figure among
the women of her day. Hone and Gainsborough
painted her portrait, fashionable society raved
about her and read her writings, and&mdash;she
played upon a favourite viola da gamba &#8220;made
in 1612, of exquisite workmanship and mellifluous
tone.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center">An Eighteenth-century Violoncello Prodigy</p>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Children</span> brought up in musical families entertained
by the sound of musical instruments
so soon acquire a musical sense as in some instances
to be regarded as prodigies. Mozart
began to compose at the age of five; and in a
paper read by Dr Burney before the Royal
Society, it is affirmed that Crotch played the air
of &#8216;Let ambition fire thy mind&#8217; when only two
years old.&#8221; Thus does that enthusiastic musical
amateur, Mr William Gardner, half-a-century
ago remark on the environment calculated to produce
that overwhelming phenomena of modern
times&mdash;the prodigy. So accustomed have modern
audiences become to the appearance of child
<i>virtuosi</i> on the concert platform that the announcement
which appeared the other day, of
a concert at the Alexandra Palace where the
orchestra would be entirely composed of 1000
girl and boy violinists, did not create any sensation.
Certainly the novelty of the prodigy has
somewhat worn off, and for this reason it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
not a little refreshing to look back and see him
when his numbers were less numerous.</p>

<p>In the accompanying illustration, reproduced
from an old print in the possession of Dr William
Cummings, we have the dual interest of a
boy under nine years of age who could play both
the violoncello and flute, and affected a certain
sensationalism by clothing himself in petticoats.
No biography of this youthful wonder&mdash;who
was apparently the <i>first</i> violoncello prodigy&mdash;is
extant, but by the aid of newspaper advertisements
it has not been difficult to trace some of
this interesting little boy&#8217;s youthful career as an
artist. In the first place it may be noticed that
the picture is engraved by M&#8216;Ardell, one of the
most celebrated engravers of his day, after the
painting of Thomas Jenkins. The latter was a
Devonshire man who studied in London under
Hudson, but eventually gave up painting, and
went to Rome, where he set himself up as a
banker and dealer in antiquities. He was not
particularly prosperous in his new undertaking,
however, and his misfortunes came to a climax
when the French occupied Rome in 1798, and
confiscated all his property. At the foot of the
picture is written &#8220;Benjamin Hallet, a child not
yet five years old, who, under the tuition of Mr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Oswald, Performed on the Flute at Drury Lane
Theatre An<sup>o</sup> 1748, for 50 nights with extraordinary
skill and applause, and the following
year was able to play his part in any Concert on
the Violoncello&#8221; truly a most accomplished
little artist, and worthy pupil of Mr James
Oswald&mdash;popular composer, flautist, and music
publisher of the day.</p>

<p>Looking among the advertisements to be found
in <i>The General Advertiser</i> for the year 1748-1749,
we came across the following which occurs
frequently in that year and confirms part of the
statement on the picture:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Drury Lane</span></p>

<p class="center">Not acted there.</p>

<p>By His Majesty&#8217;s Company of Comedians.

will be performed the last new comedy called</p>

<p class="center">THE FOUNDLING</p>

<p class="center">Fidelia by Mrs Cibber<br />
With Entertainments, viz.<br />
Act I. (By Desire) A piece of Music on<br />
the flute by <i>the child</i>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Again on the 23rd January in the same paper
we find <i>A New Way to pay Old Debts</i> advertised
to be performed at the same theatre, and among
the items included in the entertainment section
are,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Act I. A Concerto on the Flute by <i>The Child</i>.</p>

<p>Act II. A Piece of Musick by <i>The Child</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The &#8216;Piece of Musick by the Child&#8217; was
evidently a youthful composition and may be
the identical MS. mentioned by Musgrave in
his &#8220;Obituary.&#8221; Musgrave&#8217;s entries meant a
great deal to himself, but they are very puzzling
to those not initiated into the secret. Thus the
entry &#8220;Benjamin Hallet, MS. (Music)&#8221; without
date and no indication as to where it may be
found, led us to a good deal of research which
proved quite fruitless.</p>

<p>To be associated with such shining lights as
Garrick, Yates, and the charming Mrs Cibber
was an excellent send-off for &#8220;the child&#8221; and
he was doubtless the recipient of much petting
from the men and women of birth and genius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
who frequented the theatre. Who little Hallet&#8217;s
parents were, we have been unable to discover,
the only likely clue to his father is found at the
foot of Benjamin&#8217;s &#8220;benefit&#8221; programme quoted
later. There it is announced that tickets may
be had of Mr Hallet in Exeter Court, near
Exeter Exchange, in the Strand, but what was
the exact relationship between this gentleman
and the prodigy is only a matter of conjecture.
The London Directory for 1749, gives the name
of &#8220;Crowley Hallet, Old Swan Lane, Thames
Street,&#8221; and that of the year 1752 announces
that &#8220;Crowley Hallet was living near Fishmongers&#8217;
Hall, Thames Street.&#8221; In the year
1754 there was a &#8220;Captain John Hallet, Royal
Exchange, Assurance Director, and Ships&#8217;
Husband&#8221; living in &#8220;Love Lane, Aldermanbury.&#8221;
Of these two, Crowley Hallet&mdash;whose
address presupposes him to have been a tradesman&mdash;was
more likely to have been Benjamin&#8217;s
father, for the advertising genius of the day was
a great stickler for <i>class distinction</i>. If a person
of genteel birth appeared&mdash;by chance&mdash;on the
stage or concert platform, they were invariably
announced as a &#8220;gentleman,&#8221; or &#8220;gentlewoman,&#8221;
or as in the following advertisement of
a seventeenth-century prodigy, in <i>The London</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
<i>Gazette</i> for 26th November 1694:&mdash;&#8220;The Consort
of Musick in Charles Street Covent Garden
will begin again next Thursday with the addition
of two new voices, <i>one a young gentlewoman of
12 years of age</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Had Benjamin Hallet been able to claim a
&#8220;Captain&#8221; for his father, he would certainly
have been accorded the distinction of being a
&#8220;<i>young gentleman not yet nine years of age</i>.&#8221;
But surmise is of little use, for Benjamin&#8217;s
parents have faded into the land of oblivion and
left no trace of themselves except in their
talented offspring.</p>

<p>The next we hear of &#8220;the child,&#8221; is three
years later when he is announced in <i>The General
Advertiser</i> to appear in &#8220;The Old Woman&#8217;s
Oratory, conducted by Mrs Mary Midnight.&#8221;
This entertainment was one of the most humorous
and up-to-date amusements of the period.
It continued to exist for many years on and off,
and was eventually taken up by Colley Cibber,
whose drolleries gave it a further lease of life.
The names of the original promoters do not
appear on the playbills, but the name of &#8220;Mrs
Mary Midnight&#8221; perhaps but thinly veils the
half-crazy personality of Christopher Smart, the
leader and prime spirit of the choicest wits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
the day. Poor Smart was twice confined to
Bedlam for taking the injunction, &#8220;pray without
ceasing&#8221; too literally, but in spite of his evident
madness on this point, he was otherwise sane,
and few could surpass the neat wit and epigram
that flowed so freely from his ready pen. Under
the pseudonym of Mary Midnight (a name said
to have been suggested to Smart by some booth
at St Bartholomew&#8217;s Fair) he brought out a
magazine which he called <i>The Midwife, or
the Old Woman&#8217;s Magazine</i> by Mrs Mary
Midnight. This purely satirical weekly was
published by good John Newberry whose name
Goldsmith epitomised in the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;What we say of a thing that has just come in fashion,</div>
<div class="verse">And that which we do with the dead,</div>
<div class="verse">Is the name of the honestest man in the nation,</div>
<div class="verse">What more of a man can be said.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>On the 24th of December 1751, a long list
of the attractions to be found at &#8220;The Old
Woman&#8217;s Oratory,&#8221; is given in the front page
of <i>The General Advertiser</i>. The entertainment
is announced to take place at &#8220;the New Theatre
in the Haymarket, and to be conducted by Mrs
Mary Midnight and her family. Being the
second time of their appearance in public.&#8221; The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
first act opened with &#8220;A grand piece for the
Kettle Drums and Trumpets,&#8221; after which, &#8220;Mrs
Midnight made her Inauguration Speech.&#8221; The
third act consisted of, 1. &#8220;Speech of Old Time
to the Good People of Britain. 2. Solo on the
violoncello by Cupid&#8221; [the God of Love was
impersonated by little Hallet]. &#8220;3. A Song by
Mrs Midnight. 4. Another Solo by Cupid.
5. Overture to Alexander. An occasional
Prologue by a Gentleman, and an Epilogue to
be spoken by Master Hallet in the character of
Cupid. The doors to be open at Eleven
o&#8217;clock, in the morning, and the concert to begin
exactly at Twelve.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hour at which this entertainment took
place was prohibitive to the city clerk or tradesman,
but to the beaux from the neighbouring
coffee-houses, and the <i>belles dames</i> fresh from
their lengthy <i>toilette</i>, Mrs Midnight&#8217;s entertainment
proved vastly amusing. Thus little Hallet
was again amongst the <i>élite</i> of the land.</p>

<p><i>The Midwife, or Old Woman&#8217;s Magazine</i> for
1752, which claims to contain &#8220;all the wit and

and pieces said to have been spoken at the
&#8220;Old Woman&#8217;s Oratory.&#8221; Among these we
came across the following lines, which were
assigned to Benjamin Hallet in the character
of Cupid:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">EPILOGUE</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;From fair Venus on Wing,</div>
<div class="verse">A joyous Embassy I bring,</div>
<div class="verse">Her Majesty this Mandate sends,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8216;That Virtue now and Love be Friends,</div>
<div class="verse">That Beaux and Belles should cease to roam,</div>
<div class="verse">And every heart should find a Home;</div>
<div class="verse">That their joint labours they bestow</div>
<div class="verse">To make more business for my bow.</div>
<div class="verse">That Men mayn&#8217;t fail by lewd Transgression</div>
<div class="verse">But grow immortal by Succession.&#8217;</div>
<div class="verse">Now while to the ethereal Sky,</div>
<div class="verse">By Mammy&#8217;s Order, swift I fly,</div>
<div class="verse">Let Mary Midnight o&#8217;er the Nation</div>
<div class="verse">Reign Queen of Love by Deputation.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>A footnote at the end of these lines states
Hallet to be &#8220;a child not nine years old, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
plays upon the violoncello, and in every other
respect has a capacity greatly beyond his Years.
N.B. He is shortly to have a benefit, at which
&#8217;tis hoped all Mrs Midnight&#8217;s Friends will do
him the Honour of their Presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benefits were far more common in Hallet&#8217;s
time than they are now. From the great
Garrick down to the scene-shifter, all the <i>personnelle</i>
of the Theatres had their &#8220;Benefit&#8221; in
the Autumn. Concerts were not so numerous,
but concert artists also not infrequently adopted
the practice. Contemporary with Hallet Dr
Arne&#8217;s little son, who was possessed of a
wonderful singing voice, gave benefit concerts
at which he both sang and played the organ.
Then again, there was a sweet singer, Master
Mattocks; and a Miss Davies, &#8220;a child nine
years old,&#8221; who gave a concert in the Great
Room in Dean Street, Soho, and distinguished
herself by playing a &#8220;concerto of Mr Handel&#8217;s
on the Harpsichord&#8221;; and a youthful dancer
called &#8220;The little Swiss,&#8221; all of whom had their
benefits. Hallet was not &#8220;alone in his glory,&#8221;
there were several child prodigies for him to
compete with, and one cannot help admiring him
all the more, for a talent that can cope with rivalry
and hold its own, must be of no mean order.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>Unfortunately musical journalism did not begin
in England until the beginning of the last
century, so there is no possibility of gauging
Hallet&#8217;s capacities in this manner, but, doubtless,
his benefit concert met with a large measure
of support and success, for the following programme
given in <i>The General Advertiser</i> for 6th
February 1752, is of an attractive character:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">At the particular desire of Several Persons<br />

Trumpets. 2. Solo on the Violoncello by

<p>The Doors to be opened at Six o&#8217;clock; and
the Concert to begin exactly at Seven.</p>

<p>The House will be made very warm, and
illuminated with Wax Lights.</p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>Then follows the same remark about Benjamin
Hallet&#8217;s capabilities which we have already
quoted from <i>The Old Woman&#8217;s Magazine</i>,
ending with the announcement that tickets
could be had of Mr Hallet, in Exeter Court,
near Exeter Exchange, in the Strand.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that this magnificent affair
began at seven o&#8217;clock, an arrangement calculated
to admit the <i>Hoi polloi</i>, and augment the
managerial receipts, and also that the programme
reveals little Hallet to have been possessed either
of a large amount of modesty or perspicuity, for
out of the fifteen or more items there announced
only two were appropriated by himself. It
must be remembered that although such masters
as Handel, Buononcini, Arne, etc., had their
numerous admirers among the more cultured
musical amateurs, still, much of the British
public were just as pleased with the Jew&#8217;s harp,
marrow bones, and salt-box as with an oratorio
of Handel&#8217;s or an aria of Arne&#8217;s. Benjamin
probably realised the preference generally felt
for these instruments, and for this reason put
himself and the graver violoncello in the background
at his concert, allowing the Jew&#8217;s harp
and other grotesqueries the place of honour. A
most amusing satire&mdash;among others&mdash;on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
general taste for these caricatures of musical
instruments, was written by Bonnell Thornton,
whose wit would have been supreme, but for
his contemporary, Kit Smart. With excellent
humour he burlesqued the use of what he termed
those &#8220;Ancient British instruments,&#8221; in an
amusing lampoon entitled &#8220;Ode on St Cecilia&#8217;s
Day, adapted to the Ancient British Musick:
the Salt Box, the Jew&#8217;s Harp, the Marrow Bones,
and Cleavers, the Hum Strum or Hurdy Gurdy&#8221;
(London, 1762). No one appreciated this sally
more than Dr Johnson, who, it is said, delighted
in repeating extracts from it by heart. A
number of Bonnell Thornton&#8217;s quaint conceits
appeared in his magazine <i>Have at you all</i>, or
<i>The Drury Lane Journal</i>, which emulated
Fielding&#8217;s <i>Covent Garden Journal</i>, but was
neither so long lived nor so successful. Under
the pseudonym of &#8220;Mrs Roxana Termagant,&#8221;
Bonnell Thornton pursued his editorial labours,
and introduced into its pages many a burlesque
skirmish with his contemporaries&#8217; magazines,
<i>The Midwife</i> and <i>The Covent Garden Journal</i>,
and in the year 1752 a witty account of a visit
made by &#8220;Mrs Mary Midnight&#8221; to &#8220;Madam
Roxana Termagant&#8221; appeared.</p>

<p>Little Hallet was evidently a favoured <i>protégé</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
of all the wits of the day from his connection
with one of the most popular entertainments
then in vogue, and there is little doubt that he
proved an attraction, as his name appears among
the performers during the whole of the first
season and again in the following season. On
the 10th April 1753 <i>The Public Advertiser</i>
announces a concert:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">For the Benefit of<br />
Master <span class="smcap">Benjamin Hallet</span> and Sig. <span class="smcap">Gapatuns</span><br />
At the New Theatre in the Hay-market.<br />
This Day will be exhibited<br />
Mrs <span class="smcap">Mary Midnight&#8217;s Concert</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> a new occasional Prologue, to be spoken
by Master Hallet, in the character of Cupid;
and an Epilogue by Mrs Midnight on a Jack
Ass; likewise a new Song called <i>The Dust
Cart</i>, by Mr Joe, accompanied by Sig. Bombasto.
To which will be added a Grand Dance in the
old British Taste, and a hornpipe by the great
Mons. Timbertoe.</p>

<p class="center">Boxes 5s.<span class="indent3">Pit 3s.</span><span class="indent3"> Gallery 2s.</span></p>

<p>Tickets to be had at Mr Johnson&#8217;s Musick-shop
in Cheapside; Mr Peter Thomson&#8217;s in St
Paul&#8217;s Church-yard; Mr Jones&#8217;s in Holborn; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
at Mr Waylett&#8217;s in Exeter Exchange in the
Strand, and at the Theatre.</p>

<p>This will be the last time except one, that
Master <span class="smcap">Hallet</span> will perform at this Theatre.</p></blockquote>

<p>The above was in verity Hallet&#8217;s last appearance
but one at the &#8220;Old Woman&#8217;s Oratory.&#8221;
He must have been at that time nearly eleven&mdash;possibly
more, for the published age of a
prodigy is always of doubtful verity&mdash;and was
beginning to assume proportions quite unfitted
to the character of Cupid, so the management
were compelled to find a new <i>protégé</i>. The last
appearance of little Hallet on any concert platform
is to be found in <i>The Public Advertiser</i> for
Monday, 12th November 1753, at an entertainment
given at &#8220;The Five Balls,&#8221; New Church
in the Strand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">For the Benefit of a Gentleman who has<br />
wrote for the Stage.<br />
To-morrow, the 13th of November, will be a<br />
Concert of Vocal and Instrumental<br />
<br />
MUSICK.</p>

<p>In Act I. an overture of Mr Handel&#8217;s accompanied
with French Horns. A concerto of
Geminani&#8217;s on the violin. <i>God gave great</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
<i>George our King</i>, by Signor Bascado Squeekerini.
The act will conclude with a grand Piece of
Musick. In Act II. a trio on the Viol d&#8217;Amore
by Mr Grosman. A Solo on the little Flute by
Master <span class="smcap">Hallet</span>. <i>Would you take the Moon-tide
Air</i>, by Signor Bascado Squeekerini. A
Concerto on the French Horn will conclude the
Act. Between Act I. and II. will be hum&#8217;d a
<span class="smcap">Humerous Fisk</span>. In Act III. a Concerto on
the Bassoon by Mr Baumgarten. <i>The Sweet
Rosy Morning peeps over the Hills</i>, etc. by
Signor Bascado Squeekerini. The March in
Judas Maccabeus, accompanied by the Side-Drum,
concluded with a Preamble on the Kettle-Drums.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the last time Benjamin Hallet is advertised
to play either the flute or the violoncello
in that year, and many years to follow. As far
as we have been able to discover, this appearance
marked the end of the career of this first violoncello
prodigy.</p>

<p>His activity extended only over five years,
beginning at Drury Lane Theatre where he
played the flute, and ending with the above
concert where he again reverted to the first
instrument of his adoption.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
